    "name": "Spike Spiegel",
    "description": "Height: 185 cm (6' 1\")\r\nWeight: 70 kg (155 lbs)\r\nBlood type: O\r\nPlanet of Origin: Mars\n\r\nSpike Spiegel is a tall and lean 27-year-old bounty hunter born on Mars. The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, \"Waltz For Venus\". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an \"accident\"). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly \"died\". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike's gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves \"too slow\". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye \"only sees the present\" and his left eye \"only sees the past.\" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or \"No Smoking\" signs.",

    "name": "Faye Valentine",
    "description": "Birthday: August 14, 1994\n\r\nOne of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.\n\r\nSeemingly little more than a thorn in her partners\u2019 sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in \"Cowboy Funk\") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler & Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.\n\n She is a woman who is skilled at getting what she wants; however, her indomitable exterior hides a more delicate interior. Upon awakening from her 54-year cryogenic sleep, not only was she saddled with a massive amount of debt that she had no means to pay, but she was also diagnosed with total amnesia, a stranger in a mysterious world that she was not a part of and did not understand, surrounded by people who claimed to be helping her but were only there to take advantage of her naivet\u00e9. The surname \"Valentine\" was merely a name given to her by the doctor who woke her; the circumstances of her accident, her previous life, and even her real name all remain a mystery, and are only gradually revealed as the series progresses. It has been hinted that she came from Singapore on Earth, and was the daughter of a very wealthy family, as the city's famous Merlion Statue features prominently in scenes of her childhood, and that memories and a film from her childhood showed her living in a large mansion. In an early episode, she states that she is descended from Roma people, but she may well have been lying. Utterly betrayed by someone she thought she could trust after waking, Faye found herself burdened with even more money to pay, and the situation resulted in the hardening of her personality to an extreme degree. She even says in Session 11: \u201cwe deceive or we are deceived\u201d, and that \u201cnothing good ever happened to me when I trusted others.\u201d \r\nThroughout the series, though she retains her sarcastic demeanor and unpleasant nature up until the very end, it is easy to see her grow as a character. She learns to value her comrades, coming back to the Bebop when she realizes that it is the only home that she has left, naming it as the \u201conly place I could return to\u201d. She grows to understand the disadvantages of being a loner, and that even though her \"family\" is somewhat dysfunctional it is still a place where she will always belong.",

    "name": "Jet Black",
    "description": "Jet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet \"customized\" with larger engines).\n\r\nDuring the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.\n\nIn a later episode, another Vicious/Spike parallel is set up when Jet finds out that it was his old partner Fad who betrayed him (though in Jet's case, there was no love affair involved). Fad arranged for Jet's death in a setup, but he survived with only a missing arm and a scar on his face. It is worth noting that Jet managed to face the demons of his past and let them go, in contrast to Spike, who was killed when he confronted his. This is likely due to the contrast in the two approaches to the past. While Spike hid and fled from his past, Jet tracked it down and confronted it.",

    "name": "Orihime Inoue",
    "description": "Height: 5'2\" [157 cm]\r\nWeight: 45 kg\r\nBirthday: September 3\r\nZodiac: Virgo\r\nTheme Song: \"T'en va pas\" by Elsa\n\r\nOrihime Inoue has long orange-brown hair which she wears with the bangs behind her ears and hairpins. She does not remove her hairpins, except to sleep (she is seen without them in episode 64 when she wakes up), as they are worn in memory of her brother, while her hair is worn long in honor of the promise Tatsuki Arisawa once made to protect her. Her large breasts are occasionally made the subject of jokes in the series. She also has an amazingly hard head, which has injured Ury\u016b, Chad, and Ichigo. The only person who has been able to damage her head has been Yachiru Kusajishi in a comical moment when she is riding on Kenpachi Zaraki's shoulders. Orihime has yellow-orange/brown eyes in colored pictures of the manga, but gray eyes in the anime.\n\r\nOrihime is friendly, humorous in her own way, sensitive, and kind. She comes off as naive and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school. Apparently, she is hopeless when it comes to technology. One of the members of the Handicrafts' Club remarks that she is not smart enough to use a cell phone, which is why she does not have one. Additionally, according to Tatsuki, Orihime has the fighting skill of a black belt, however, in the English dubbed version she says Orihime is at the skill of a yellow belt.\n\r\nOrihime cooks and eats strange food at home, although she also likes some normal food. Aside from Rangiku Matsumoto and possibly Tessai Tsukabishi, no one shares Orihime's tastes. Her favorite food is red bean paste, and she likes putting butter on sweet potatoes.\n\r\nOrihime has a tendency to rush into situations without thinking, sometimes leading to embarrassing consequences. At one point, the schoolgirls ask Rukia if she has feelings for Ichigo. When Rukia denies any such thing, Orihime is disappointed that Rukia does not share her sentiments, because if she had, then it would be two girls against one boy and therefore the girls \"team\" would win, which makes no sense. She also tends to have an overactive imagination and gets carried away thinking of implausible scenarios, such as portraying herself as a futuristic and apparently highly destructive robot in an assignment asking \"How do you see yourself in the future?\", when the question refers to what occupation one wishes or believes they will have.\n\r\nOrihime has also demonstrated that she is perceptive, mostly when it comes to Ichigo Kurosaki. She is in love with Ichigo, and in both the manga and anime, her feelings only become more evident as time goes on. She has revealed these feelings both to Rangiku Matsumoto and to Ichigo himself, though he was asleep at the time. She also has the uncanny ability to detect Ichigo by scent and sense his spiritual pressure, even when masked by the visored.\n\r\nOrihime lives by herself in Karakura Town, where the story takes place, and is supported by relatives living elsewhere. Previously, she had lived with her older brother, Sora, who was fifteen years older than her. She and her brother were raised by a drunk father and an unfaithful mother, who always argued and beat their children. It is unknown if her parents are still alive.\n\r\nWhen Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her since. For six years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her long hair. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. On the same day, Sora was wounded in a car accident and died in the Kurosaki clinic. Orihime has worn the hairpins ever since. A year after Sora died, Orihime met Tatsuki who defended her from the bullies. They have been best friends ever since.",

    "name": "Edward Elric",
    "description": "Birthday: 1899\r\nBirthplace: Resembool, Amestris\r\nFamily: Alphonse Elric (brother); Trisha Elric (mother, deceased); Van Hohenheim (father)\r\nAffiliations: State Military, Winry Rockbell, Pinako Rockbell, Izumi Curtis (teacher), Roy Mustang (Commander)\r\nSpecies: Human\r\nOccupation: State Alchemist\r\nAbilities: Alchemy, Martial Arts\r\nWeapon: Alchemy, automail arm and leg\n\r\nEdward \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" Elric is a young alchemical prodigy. He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.\n\r\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11\"), however, his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\n\r\nBorn to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dead mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\n\r\nEdward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. \n\r\nThough instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the \"One is All, All is One\" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics of a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.\n\r\nDevising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.\n\r\nAlphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God's domain and peeking at the Gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life.\n\r\nOn the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbell's in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother's body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automail at age 11 when it took most adults 3 years.",

With his parents and family now gone, his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.\n\r\nAfter his fight with Naruto, he believes he's been wasting his time \"playing ninja\" with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing Itachi and then restore the Uchiha clan.\n\r\nAs a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.\n\r\nClaiming at first that he doesn't need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. Sasuke openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.\n\nAppearance\r\nSasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.\n\r\nAt the beginning of Part I, Sasuke's clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.\n\r\nIn Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that's open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. He also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in Curse Seal Level 2 room to move (also without transforming).\n\nSasuke, even though claiming to be emotionless, wouldn't kill unless it was necessary until Madara Uchiha twisted his personality even further by telling him that his brother, Itachi, after he had killed him, was ordered to kill their clan and suffer for the sake of the village. After knowing this, he suddenly turns far colder and seeks for revenge on Konoha. However, after he had calmed down, he noticed how confused he really was and revived Orochimaru to request answers to his questions about his clan, Konoha, and what shinobi and the Hokage really are. He's currently helping Naruto and the others put an end to the war and announced that he plans to become the next Hokage. But when the the war concluded, Sasuke made it clear that his goal was to become a new kind of Hokage, a kind of Hokage that wants to banish darkness from the Ninja World and to do so he believes all the old Kages should be killed. He also wants to conclude things with Naruto and so he invites him to one final concluding battle. The battle ends with both Naruto and Sasuke losing one of their hands. While both lie on the ground he finally accepts Naruto's feelings and stops his path of revenge to return to the village.\nIn chapter 700, it is shown that he has a daughter with Sakura.",

    "description": "Birthday: June 9th (Gemini)\r\nHeight: 175 cm (I); 178 cm (II)\r\nWeight: 57 kg (I); 58 kg (II)\r\nBlood Type: AB\r\nNature Type: Fire and Water\r\nFrom: Konohagakure (Leaf)\r\nRank: S-class Missing-Nin\r\nRegistered Ninja #: 012110\r\nAffiliation: Akatsuki\r\nRing: Shu (Red)\r\nFinger Position: Right Ring\r\nPartner: Hoshigaki Kisame\r\nFavorite Foods: Rice balls (kelp), cabbage, Dango\r\nLeast Favorite Foods: Steak\r\nHobby: Visiting traditional Japanese caf\u00e9s\r\nFirst Manga Appearance: Ch. 139\r\nFirst Anime Appearance: Ep. 80\r\nAssignments Completed: 53 D-Rank, 152 C-Rank, 134 B-Rank, 0 A-Rank, 1 S-Rank\r\nFamous Quote: Foolish little brother, if you wish to kill me, hate me, detest me, and survive in an unsightly way. Run, run and cling to life.\n\r\nBackground:\r\nItachi Uchiha is a missing-nin from Konohagakure, and a prominent member of Akatsuki, partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki. He is Sasuke Uchiha's older brother. \n\r\nItachi is relatively popular among many fans of Naruto, often having ranked in the top ten in Shonen Jump magazine's popularity polls since his introduction. He was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. He was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.\n\r\nItachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi's prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre.\n\r\nHe was praised highly by his father, who saw the family's future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi's younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.\n\nWhen the Uchiha began planning to overthrow Konoha, Itachi, as an ANBU, was tasked with spying on the village. Knowing that a coup d'etat would only lead to another Ninja War, Itachi chose to spy on the Uchiha instead, passing on information to the Third Hokage and the other Konoha elders. After this he began to act strangely, not attending the clan meetings, speaking out against the clan, and becoming the prime suspect for the murder of his best friend, Shisui Uchiha. The clan lost hope in Itachi, and his father began shifting his focus to Sasuke instead. Meanwhile, the Third's attempts to negotiate a bloodless end to hostilities between the two parties were proving ineffective, so, against the Third's wishes, Danzo and the Konoha Council ordered Itachi to wipe out the Uchiha.\n\r\nBefore the fateful night arrived, Itachi discovered the existence of Madara Uchiha, who was attempting to rekindle the flames of war in Konoha. In return for not attacking Konoha, Itachi offered to help Madara claim vengeance against the Uchiha for turning their backs on him decades earlier. Madara agreed. Itachi slaughtered his entire clan overnight, sparing only Sasuke. Sasuke's life was worth more than the village to Itachi, and he could not follow through with the orders to kill him as well. Instead, he made himself out as a villain, who had killed their innocent family only to test his abilities. By doing so, he wanted Sasuke to take vengeance on him and become a hero to Konoha, thus redeeming the Uchiha name. He tortured Sasuke with his Mangekyo Sharingan, and encouraged him to become strong enough to kill him and avenge their family. Hoping that his beloved little brother would someday be powerful enough to kill him, Itachi left the village as a traitor.\n\r\nKnowing that Konoha would still want to eliminate Sasuke, Itachi pleaded with the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe. He also threatened Danzo to not harm Sasuke or risk him revealing everything he knew about Konoha's secrets to enemy countries. Sasuke's safety was therefore secured, and Itachi returned to his original plan of becoming infamous for his slaughter of the Uchiha. \n\r\nItachi joined Akatsuki in order to keep an eye on the organization, along with Madara Uchiha, in case either ever acted against Konoha, all the while planning for his death at Sasuke's hands. While a member of Akatsuki, Itachi was approached by Orochimaru, who tried to steal his body to gain the Sharingan. Itachi trapped him in a genjutsu and severed his left hand as punishment, forcing Orochimaru to flee the organization. Sometime after joining Akatsuki, Itachi later helped recruit Deidara, Orochimaru's replacement, by beating him in battle, after which Deidara swore vengeance again.\r\nPersonality:\nEver since his first appearance, Itachi had always been mysterious, and had acted as though he was hiding his true self. While flashbacks to his past showed that he was a compassionate brother and person, his later acts and claims made it seem that this was mostly just an act. But, surprisingly, he genuinely was the compassionate brother he had once claimed to be, although he hid this from the rest of the Akatsuki to protect Sasuke.\r\nAs a member of Akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. He constantly displayed an emotionless personality. He only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn't lose his composure. He did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.\n\r\nIn addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, Itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. He was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. He also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, Itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.\n\r\nItachi's only initial interest was in Akatsuki's goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization's success and secrecy before everything else. As such, Itachi got along with his partner, Kisame, much better than most other Akatsuki members did with their own partners. Kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to Itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. Itachi treated all of his fellow Akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.\n\nHowever, when he was in a genjutsu duel during his fight with Sasuke, he cruelly claimed he'd only let Sasuke live so that he could take Sasuke's eyes and obtain his own Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, after which he then claimed the Uchiha clan had been nothing but tainted and evil, since many members would kill their friends to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan, and would take another Uchiha's eyes to make its power permanent. Once the genjutsu was released, he called it his true self, implying his calm, emotionless personality was also a facade. This persona was later revealed to be only an act to ensure that he would die by Sasuke's hands, his love for his younger brother being the fundamental aspect of his personality. \r\nDespite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. While living in Konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. After joining Akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. He was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.\n\r\nHe, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. He also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his Akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). Being brothers, Itachi and Sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. Itachi's hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. His skin was also slightly darker. Itachi's most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.\n\r\nWhen he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large Uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. When on duty, he would wear the traditional ANBU uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the traditional Akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. After his cloak was incinerated by Sasuke's Kirin during their fight in Part II, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. Like almost all members of Akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, Konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village (although, secretly, he was actually still loyal to his village).\r\nAbilities:\r\nSince a young age, Itachi's intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. In the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, Itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the Naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat Deidara, Sasuke, Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yuhi and Orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in Naruto. Being a pacifist, Itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.\n\r\nSharingan:\r\nBeing of the Uchiha Clan, and as noted by Kakashi, Itachi was a true successor of the Sharingan Eye. From a stationary position, he would study an opponent's movements with his Sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. He could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent's genjutsu against them with Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change. Itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his Sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels. \n\r\nMangekyo Sharingan:\r\nItachi possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. With his left eye, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent's mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. His final technique was Susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"Raging God of Battle\" in the databook. It wielded the Totsuka Sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and Yata's Mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. Zetsu, a fellow Akatsuki member, stated that Itachi's mastery of the Sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of Susanoo, made him invincible.\n\nDespite his mastery of the Mangekyo Sharingan, Itachi suffered greatly from its side effects. His eyesight would worsen after every activation of the Mangekyo Sharingan, and he would eventually go blind from its power, with his Sharingan forever sealed away. Itachi was so close to blindness that, by the time he activated Susanoo in his final fight, both Sharingan eyes had become almost blind, and had turned white. However, he was still able to perform his own F\u016binjutsu in his last moments.\r\n(Source: Naruto.com, Naruto Wikia)",

    "description": "Homeland: Tokyo, Japan\r\nGender: Male\r\nFamily: Hiroko Makunouchi (Mother); Kazuo Makunouchi (Father); Wanpo (Pet)\r\nOccupation: Professional Boxer; Makunouchi Fishing Boat   \r\nWeight Class: Featherweight  \r\nHeight: 164 cm (5'5\")\r\nReach: 165 cm (65\")\r\nStyle: Infighter; Peek-A-Boo Style\r\nCurrent Affiliation: Kamogawa Boxing Gym\r\nTrainer: Genji Kamogawa\r\nSpecialty: Liver Blow; Gazelle Punch; Dempsey Roll\n\r\nIppo Makunouchi is the main protagonist of the series. He lives with his mother, Hiroko Makunouchi, and helps with the family charter boat fishing business. Ippo is a classic power in-boxer and is well known for his Peek-a-Boo style of boxing and hard punches which include three signature punches: a rib-cracking liver blow, Gazelle punch (an uppercut variant), and the Dempsey roll technique. His signature punches appear to be modelled after Mike Tyson, Floyd Patterson and Jack Dempsey respectively.\n\r\nIppo is bullied throughout most of his school life. After being rescued by Takamura, he ends up being brought to Kamogawa Gym, where he displays an explosive punching power. After seeing a video of Mike Tyson, he becomes inspired to take up boxing to feel reborn with strength. He soon proves himself to Takamura and Kamogawa, and starts on the path to being a pro boxer.\n\r\nHis Pro-Debut Match was against Oda Yusuke, He was largely regarded as a lazy and unmotivated boxer, but when his girlfriend threatened to break up with him, he committed himself to training. From the first time the boxers met, there was tension between them, as a misunderstanding led Oda to believe Ippo made fun of him. On the actual fight, Ippo seemed to have the advantage from the beginning of the match, but was saved by his coach from losing the fight due to a cut. Ippo managed a comeback by knocking Oda out with a series of jabs, thus winning the fight.\n\nAfter winning two fights upon his debut as a pro-boxer, Coach Kamogawa enlisted Ippo in the East Japan Rookie King Tournament. Ippo also had his personal goal in the tournament to fight with Miyata in the Pro Ring for their tie-breaker match. With this promise in mind Ippo aims to reach the East Japan finals.\n\r\nFirst Round: Jason Ozuma Ozuma is a black officer from America who was stationed in Japan, and the only black boxer Ippo has faced so far. Jason is a very polite and kind man who cares greatly for his gym and friends. His most revered attacks, his devastating Hooks, are comparable to Takamura's in terms of speed. Ippo had to enter an in fight to win the first round. Ippo took major hits, but managed to turn the match around by pressuring Ozuma with his power. After an intense round, Ippo managed to take advantage of Ozuma's wide swing and his delayed punch, due to a broken rib, to deliver a second down and win the match.\n\r\nSecond Round: Kobashi Kenta Kobashi Kenta is a boxer that depends on winning with points. Ippo is annoyed by Kobashi's technique, which is to clinch often; eventually Kobashi's strategy, to rob Ippo of his stamina, takes effect. However, in the final round (the 4th round), Kobashi punches Ippo with a counter and becomes excited at the prospect of landing a KO on Ippo. Even though his second disapproved, his desire to gain a KO victory lead him to fight head-on, but Ippo took his chance the instant Kobashi stepped outside the pure, no-risk outboxing and KO'ed him.\n\r\nSemi-final Round: Hayami Ryuuichi A pretty boy boxer who held the title of Inter High Champion with his fast barrage of punches called the Shotgun and Ippo's first opponent as an out boxer. Hayami looked down upon Ippo, and dismissed him since he felt Ippo was an unworthy opponent. Hayami's strategy uses a short uppercut against dashing infighters and finishes them with his Shotgun. Ippo, however, manages to counter him by using a cross hook counter against his short uppercut, and sees through the storm of punches. Having finally mastered bobbing and weaving at the training camp, he was able to avoid and get close to Hayami. Ippo finished the fight with a rush followed by an uppercut to win the fight in 1 round moving to the finals.\n\r\nEast Japan Final Round: Mashiba Ryou Ippo's final opponent in the East Japan Rookie King tournament defeated Miyata with a controversial foul and seemed poised to take the Rookie King Title. Ippo met Mashiba at his pro license exam, and has since been afraid of his dark demeanor throughout most of the series (albeit comically), but after witnessing Mashiba's foul, Ippo goes into the match determined to win. Initially, Mashiba's flicker jabs exploited Ippo's short reach by keeping him at bay, but Ippo eventually slipped in, broke Mashiba's elbow (at the expense of his right hand), and slugged it out with him. Ippo gave Mashiba his first and only legitimate black star in the form of a heavy and painful K.O victory.\n\nSince Ippo had broken his fist, the All Japan Round didn't seem like a possibility, but when Ippo met Sendou, the West Japan Rookie King, in person, he decided to go ahead with the fight. He received therapy from Doctor Yamaguchi which allowed him to fight with a proper hand. The match was an intense slug-fight which ended abruptly before the fourth round when Sendou turned out to be unconscious in his corner, despite still sitting upright looking ready to continue.\nAfter winning the All Japan Rookie Tournament, Ippo found that his rival Miyata was going overseas. Ippo was left with no current goal to motivate him. Rehabilitating his hand injured from his previous fight, Ippo breaks from training and starts supporting his fellow boxers at Kamogawa Gym in their fights. He then meets the current National Feather Weight Champion Date Eiji, who hints that in the future they may face each other since Ippo is already ranked number 10 upon winning the Rookie King Tournament. Ippo realizes that he wants to fight the Champion and trains for his new challenge. And he proceeds to do this by entering an A class tournemant and defeating Okita Keigo,  Saeki Takuma and  Alexander Volg Zangief.   Date Eiji After earning his right to challenge Date Eiji, one of Japan's most revered boxers, Ippo went into the match bringing everything he had learned in his past 10 matches with him. For the first few rounds he succeeded in pushing the champion to his limits. However, when Eiji began using the high-level Neck Spin to negate most of the power behind Ippo's punches, Ippo becomes disoriented. Eiji gradually returns to his style of fighting from his younger days. He delivers a powerful Heart Break Shot that stuns Ippo, then prepares to deliver the finishing blow. But the referee stops the match because Kamogawa had already thrown in the towel. Victory goes to  Date Eiji. Thanks to this match, Date regains his confidence in challenging the world champion, Ricardo Martinez. He relinquishes his belt, leaving Sendou Takeshi and Alexander Volg Zangief to fight for it. Sendou wins by a controversial decision and becomes the new Japanese Featherweight champion. Ponchai Chuwatana A Thai fighter ranked 3rd in Thailand who faces Ippo following his 5 month break against Date Eiji. Ponchai had a very well-built physique and a strong determination to win in his boxing matches.in the second round, Ippo starts to land small punches while swaying left and right, before speeding up and finishing Ponchai off with his new finishing move, the \"Dempsey Roll.\"After this match, Sendou, the new featherweight champion, challenged Ippo to a match personally. Sendou Takeshi The continuation of the unfinished match between the hard punchers of East and West. Ippo and Sendou had been looking forward to a match since the All Japan Rookie Championship was unfinished in their minds. To prepare for the match they both strengthened their weaknesses through new training methods, Sendou improving his lower body and Ippo his upper body.\n\r\nThis match is considered to be one of the most intense since both fighters had roughly the same amount of punching power resulting in numerous slug fests and a footstomp from the audience that shook the hall. Ippo originally had problems since he had a smaller body, meaning he had a little bit less muscle and was going to lose unless he started to connect more punches than Sendou did. But with encouragement from his friends and remembering his training he managed to continue his match against Sendou. The match turned into a mix up, where both fighters drew out the others' potential and helped each other grow stronger. With one final showdown between their signature finishers, Ippo managed to pull through and finish Sendou off by inventing a combo of his 3 strongest techniques to take the belt and title. Sendou then personally congratulated Ippo.\nAfter obtaining the National Japanese Feather Weight Belt from Sendou, Ippo defended the title successfully for eight consecutive times.\nAfter yet another canceled fight with Ichiro Miyata, Ippo lost his drive and thought of retiring from boxing. However with the help of Iimura Mari and the words of his friends and previous opponent, he was able to find his true goal which is to become strong and went back to Kamogawa Gym to continue Boxing. Kamogawa then tells Ippo to aim for the World, but having them cut off the shortest route of getting to the top rankings by beating the OPBF Champ Miyata, Kamogawa tells Ippo that he will take a different path, which is to defeat all of the OPBF National Champions, obtaining their WBC rankings and becoming an unofficial OPBF Champion.\nAfter his fight with Kojima, Ippo was told by the coach that he would be relinquishing the JBC Featherweight Title and moving up to challenging world rankers. His first match as a world contender is against Alfredo Gonzales, the 2nd ranked Featherweight in the WBA and 3rd ranked Featherweight in the WBC.  in the 7th round, the boxers enter yet another exchange which Ippo wins, but as he goes for the finishing blow, Alfredo lands a powerful right counter and sends Ippo to the canvas, where he lays motionless. Kamogawa runs into the ring to help Ippo and the referee declares a TKO.\n\r\nAs of this fight, Alfredo is the second person to knock Ippo unconscious.\nTotal Fights: 25. Wins: 23, All of which are by KO. Losses: 3.",

In one episode, she considers putting on socks and shoes, but quickly removes them, as even wearing socks hampers her, and she falls over seconds after putting them on; she also appears to be exceptionally strong and flexible, being able to support her weight on her arms for several minutes at a time, and to scratch her nose with her toe.\n\r\nIn the English version, she almost always refers to herself in the third person.\n\r\nNot much is known about her origins, only that she spent some of her earlier childhood in an orphanage after being left there by her father, a man named Afedersiniz Hesap L\u00fctfen (he calls Ed \"Fran\u00e7oise\", and may be of Turkish origin as his name means \"excuse me, check please\" in Turkish). In the manga it is revealed that she was a friend of a timid young boy in the orphanage known simply as \"Tomato\" (which also happens to be the brand name scrawled in katakana on her PC) who, like Ed, knew a great deal about computers and the net, and it is probably safe to assume that his friendship with Ed helped turn her into the genius-hacker she is today.\n\r\nEd's primary use to the Bebop crew is as a hacker; she is widely known to be a whiz kid behind a computer. Ed's computer of choice is a carry-along Tomato desktop, an homage to the portable flatpanel-outfitted Apple IIc from the 80s, and when traveling by foot she will balance it on her head.\n\r\nEd has a strong rapport with Jet, who acts as a surrogate father, and Faye, who acts as something of a big sister (much to Faye's chagrin). Ed also seems to be the only person who can understand Ein (though in a few instances Jet could understand Ein also).",

When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village, sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.\n\r\nDespite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto be viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a Jinchuuriki) the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demon were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracized by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.\n\r\nNaruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.\n\r\nVowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.\n\r\nIn all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.\n\nHe becomes the hero of his village, after defeating the six Pains all by himself.\nHe then befriends the nine-tails inside of him and control its powers. In time, he also becomes more dependable considering the Shinobi Alliance completely relies and respects his power, even the reanimated previous Hokages.\nHe later receives chakra from all the nine tailed beasts and then gains the power of the sage of the six paths, along with Sasuke.\nAt the end of the manga, he is married to Hinata with two children, Boruto and Himawari, and becomes the seventh hokage.",

She cut her hair short because of a little boy who got gum stuck in it, but this action caused the Host club to mistake her for guy. However, unlike the other students, she is from a commoner family and got into Ouran through a scholarship. On her first day at school, she accidentally breaks a vase worth 8 million yen belonging to the Host Club. As a result, she is forced to work as a host to pay off her debt, and does so by disguising herself as a boy. Soon enough, she naturally takes to acting as a host to other girls, and even finds it enjoyable. However, she does not like to take time away from studying and often finds the antics of the other hosts to be annoying. Haruhi lives with her okama (cross dressing) father. As a result of her mother passing away when she was young, Haruhi has become very independent and never lets anyone worry about her. Although seemingly unflappable, she has a fear of thunderstorms.\n\nHaruhi was very popular back in middle school, and was confessed to at least once a month. However, like Tamaki, she is very dense when it comes to love, and has broken many hearts unintentionally. Later in the manga, she realizes her love for Tamaki, and begins to blush whenever he is around.\n\r\nEventually she leaves Japan to study abroad and, of course, the whole club joins her (even Honey and Mori!). In the last chapter of the manga there's a picture of Tamaki and her getting married.",

He is the antithesis to his best friend, Kyoya Ootori. While Kyoya is calm, cool, and calculating, Tamaki is flamboyant, emotional, and narcissistic; however, he is extremely dedicated to his duties as a host. He is the \"prince\" host type, who can charm any girl with sweet talk\u2014yet he is always truthful in his compliments. To him, all girls are pretty, and the happiness of his guest is his greatest enjoyment. Tamaki acts as the main comic relief in the series, exemplified in his extremely dense and na\u00efve approach to his own feelings, and extreme emotional reactions to Haruhi's comments about his stupidity. He has a family complex, as he asks Haruhi to call him \"Daddy\" and refers to Kyoya as \"Mommy.\" He is shown to be partial to classical piano music and plays extremely well; one of his favorite pieces being Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major.\n\nTamaki is revealed to be half-French and half-Japanese. His real name is Rene Tamaki Richard Grantaine. His father, the superintendent of Ouran Academy, fell in love with Tamaki's French mother and divorced his first wife to marry her. For that reason, Tamaki's paternal grandmother harbors a strong hatred towards Tamaki. Nevertheless, he is constantly trying to get her to accept him as part of the Suou family. Because of his family situation, Tamaki sees the Host Club as one big family and tries to maintain that illusion, to the extent of telling himself that his love for Haruhi is fatherly even when it is clearly not.\n\r\nLater in the manga, Tamaki gets closer to Haruhi even though he says it's mostly like a father; however, he tells Kyoya the reason why he hasn't been cheerful is because of his stricken love for Haruhi.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Later in the manga, both Hikaru and Kaoru fall in love with Haruhi; although she has already rejected him once, Hikaru is determined to not lose to Tamaki. Eventually, however, Hikaru accepts that Haruhi loves Tamaki, and instead encourages her to confess to him, saying he is over her and wants her and Tamaki to get together (although he always looks pained as he says this).\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In his words, \"use whatever is at hand, be it friend or foe.\" Almost everything he does is for his own benefit, but he can occasionally display a selfless side. He is the third son of his very wealthy and influential family; thus, if he wants to take over his family's business, he must work extremely hard to meet his strict father's high expectations. Also, Kyouya's bad temper when waking up in the morning has earned him the name \"Low-Blood Pressure Evil Lord.\"\n\nDespite being Tamaki's opposite, Kyouya has been known to support him in certain situations. One example being episode 8. Haruhi tried saving a bunch of girls from a group of molesters by throwing shells at them. One of them threw her over the edge of a small cliff. Tamaki rescued her, but later yelled at her for intervening and that girls shouldn't try to fight a group of boys. Haruhi countered that by saying that being a girl or boys doesn't matter in the real world. Later, she wandered into Kyouya's room in the villa they were staying at and Kyouya threw Haruhi on his bed and attempted to rape her. She told him that he wouldn't do it because he wouldn't gain anything. He backed off and Haruhi realized he did what he did to prove that she couldn't defend herself. His rape attempt was only to show that Tamaki was right and she won't always be able to win every fight. \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He befriended Gon almost immediately and has loyally followed his best friend since then.\n\r\nKillua is usually a kind-hearted and cheerful, cheeky boy, but if provoked, he becomes extremely deadly and bloodthirsty, able to kill an enemy in seconds.\n\r\nHe is confident and aware of his abilities and strengths, and not afraid to speak his mind, but also smart enough to know when to hold his tongue. He can get embarrassed easily when someone compliments him or openly shows affection towards him.\n\r\nHe is very intelligent and quick-thinking, and skilled in analysis, particularly induction. He is able to calmly and rapidly form strategies to adapt to stressful situations.\n\r\nDue to his training as an assassin, it's an ingrained habit of his to be extremely cautious when approaching a fight, often assuming the worst case scenario, so he is quicker to flee than to try to face an apparently stronger opponent. For most of the series, this is his greatest flaw. He is also a loyal friend who is selfless to a fault, and suffers greatly trying to help his friends without a single thought to his own health. \n\r\nHe is also from the transmutation Nen group. He constantly strives to improve his Nen ability, developing many interesting techniques as time moves on.\n\r\nHe is also the third person to have a transmutation Nen as his father and grandfather also are transmutation Nen users. Coincidentally, all three family members have silver hair.",

    "description": "Age: 17 (beginning); 19 (current)\r\nHeight: 171 cm\r\nWeight: 59 kg\r\nBirthday: April 4\r\nZodiac: Aries\r\nHair color: blonde\r\nEye color: blue (1999); brown (manga & 2011); scarlet (when angered)\r\nBlood type: AB\r\nNen type: Conjuration; Specialization (when his eyes are Scarlet)\r\nAbilities: Holy Chain, Dowsing Chain, Chain Jail, Judgment Chain\n\r\nKurapika is a member of the Kurta tribe who were massacred by the Phantom Troupe (The Spiders) 4 years prior the Hunter exam. The Kurta tribe was an isolated group of people whose eyes would turn scarlet when angered or excited. These scarlet eyes were known to be beautiful, being one of the seven most beautiful in the world. Because of this, the Kurta tribe was constantly pursued and eventually massacred. The eyes of the tribe members were all taken away during the massacre. Kurapika is so far the only known survivor with a heart bent on revenge. He strives to have his revenge against the Phantom Troupe as well as recover the eyes of his tribe members.\n\r\nDespite having a heart full of hatred, Kurapika is very kind and loyal towards his friends. He is an extremely intelligent person but at the same time reckless. Kurapika is from the materialization nen group and from determination, increased the power of his nen ability to the point that it was formidable against the Phantom Troupe.\n\r\nKurapika can conjure a unique weapon \u2014 five chains that extend from each finger on his right hand. Some of the fingers were specially designed to deal vengeance on the Phantom Troupe. To increase his effectiveness against the formidable Phantom Troupe, Kurapika places strict Limitations on the usage of his chains. The purpose of the chain on Kurapika's index finger has yet to be revealed.\n\r\nKurapika's Techniques\n\r\nHoly Chain (\u7652\u3059\u89aa\u6307\u306e\u9396 \u30db\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3 The Healing Thumb Chain): Type Conjuration and Enhancement Shaped like a cross, it cures wounds by drawing from Enhancement abilities. When Kurapika is in his Specialist state, its ability is Enhanced and can heal serious injuries within seconds.\r\nChain Jail (\u675f\u7e1b\u3059\u308b\u4e2d\u6307\u306e\u9396 \u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30a4\u30eb The Restraining Middle Finger Chain): Type Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation Shaped like a hook, it wraps around Spiders and restricts their movement. Also forcefully causes its prisoners to enter Zetsu, shutting off their aura and preventing the use of Nen abilities. Escape from the Chain Jail is only possible through brute force. Kurapika imposed a limitation onto this chain, it can only be used to deal with members of the Phantom Troupe. If this condition is violated, Kurapika will die. This condition was needed in order to increase the strength of the ability.\r\nDowsing Chain (\u5c0e\u304f\u85ac\u6307\u306e\u9396 \u30c0\u30a6\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3 The Guiding Ring Finger Chain): Type Conjuration Shaped like a ball and chain, Kurapika uses this frequently under normal situations, for defensive and offensive purposes. It is also useful for other investigative activities, like determining the location of missing individuals. He also uses this chain to identify if someone is lying. It has a small ball-like weight at the end which moves in the direction of whatever he is dowsing for.\r\nJudgment Chain (\u5f8b\u3059\u308b\u5c0f\u6307\u306e\u9396 \u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30b8\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3 The Arbiter Little Finger Chain): Type Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation \u200bThe Stake of Retribution, a blade on the end of the Judgment Chain, enters the victim's body and wraps around the heart. Kurapika sets two conditions and if the victim violates either one, the chain crushes the heart, killing them. It can only be used while Kurapika's eyes are scarlet. Kurapika himself has a blade wrapped around his heart, which he used to set the conditions of use for his Chain Jail ability.\r\nEmperor Time (\u7d76\u5bfe\u6642\u9593 \u30a8\u30f3\u30da\u30e9\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0 Absolute Mastery): Type Specialization When Kurapika's eyes shift into scarlet, he changes from a Conjurer to a Specialist. This ability allows him to utilize all the types of Nen to 100% efficiency (for a Conjurer). In the manga, Kurapika explains this using the terms \"Level\" and \"Force/Accuracy\". Kurapika's \"Levels\" in the various Nen categories remain the same during Emperor Time, however, his Force and Accuracy for every category is raised to 100%. Thus, if Kurapika's Level in Conjuration were 10, his Level in Emission (the polar opposite aura type) would be 4, and during Emperor Time, he would be evenly matched against a Level 4 Emitter at 100%. Outside of Emperor Time, his Force and Accuracy in Emission would at most be only be 40%.",

His abusive behavior also distanced her from her gender: he treated her like a boy, refusing to allow her to use feminine products and basic hygiene products. There are also subtle hints that her father is an alcoholic. After awaking from her coma, Ryo Sakuma, the player behind Bear, becomes her legal guardian and allows her to go to a boarding school. She meets with Mariko, Subaru's player.",

    "name": "Luffy Monkey D.",
    "description": "Age: 17; 19\r\nBirthdate: May 5, Taurus\r\nHeight: 172 cm; 174 cm\r\nBlood type: F\r\nAffiliation: Straw Hat Pirates\r\nPosition: Captain\r\nDevil fruit: Gomu Gomu no Mi (Gum Gum Fruit)\r\nType: Paramecia\r\nBounty:1,500,000,000 (previously; 30,000,000, 100,000,000, 300,000,000, 400,000,000 and 500,000,000)\n\r\nLuffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and is best friends with all of them and values them over all else. At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in a childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.\n\r\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D.\"\n\r\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism, and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he is intimidated at the mere mention of him.\n\r\nLuffy never kills any of his enemies, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or beating them to a point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.\n\r\nLuffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.\n\nMonkey D. Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army and the world's most wanted criminal. His grandfather is \"The Hero of The Marines,\" Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp.\n\r\nBefore the start of the series, Dragon left Luffy in Garp's care. Dragon first appears after a lightning bolt suddenly destroys the gallows where Luffy was to be executed by Buggy the Clown and then saves Luffy from being captured by Captain Smoker. When he saved Luffy from Smoker, a mighty gust of eerie wind swept through Loguetown. It is undetermined whether or not he was the cause of the gust of wind or the lightning; however, the story leads to believe there is more to him than it seems. Recently, he has taken over an island in the South Blue and is about to head to the North Blue when he commented, after noticing Luffy's newest bounty, given to him after invading Enies Lobby, that father and son will meet sometime soon.",

With his unruly hair (He's often called \"Urchin Head\") and sunglasses, people already judge him poorly (It doesn't help that he gives unflattering nicknames to almost anyone he meets, e.g. \"monkey trainer\" Shido and \"thread spool\" Kazuki). But he is actually a great guy with a strong sense of leadership and a very talented person. He is one quarter German and he's the grandchild of the \"Last Witch of the 20th Century\".\n\r\nHe's also a brother-like figure to Kudou Himiko after she has gotten over her brother's death. Himiko's average fighting skills meant that she often bites off more than what she can chew. In such situations, Ban can be counted on to come to her aid (though it must be noted that she does return the favor at times).\n\r\nIn the GB duo, he's often the one who thinks of plans for their moves. Initially, Ginji was seen to be a sidekick to him. (In fact, when they first formed their partnership, Ban insisted that Ginji was only his sidekick.) As the story progresses, Ginji gradually held his own in their missions, and Ban acknowledged him as an equal.\n\r\nBan is feared due to his procession of the Jagan, a power which allows him to make anyone he makes eye contact with to watch a one minute long illusion, however, it should only be used three times per day. The Evil Eye cannot be used on the same person again for the next 24 hours. Furthermore, while the illusion only lasts for one minute, should Ban will it, the one affected by the Jagan can be placed inside a time-warp zone via the illusion created by the technique, meaning that to them, one minute in real life could last up to several hours in the Jagan's influence. \n\r\nBecause he is a direct descendant of the Witch clan, and being born under the star of Asclepius, he possesses incredible superhuman strength, which gives him a gripping force of 200 kgf (2 kN) in each hand. It is also shown that he is strong enough break open the doors of an armored steel truck and punch hard enough to create large craters in the ground or break walls; occasionally even collapsing multi-storied buildings.\n\r\nAt full power, his right hand becomes a snake's claw that can crush anything. Also, while powering up, the astral outline of a giant snake can be seen surrounding him. The general impression of people when taking their first look at him is of a skinny or ordinary person; however, a close look will reveal that he is of a fair height and has solid shoulders and large, muscular and solid arms. His unruly ordinary appearance often deceive enemies and they don't expect his level of superhuman super strength.",

Flame scent [Kaenkou] will make a person's body burn from the inside, causing them to breathe fire; regression scent [Taikoukou] causes the brain functions to be reduced to minimum, turning people into essentially monkeys; puppet scent [Kugutsukou], which makes others obey her every command; tracking scent [Tsuibikou] which will allow her to track her own movements, or for others to follow her trail; time scent [Jigenkou] that ceases all muscle movement in the victim at the designated time; corrosion scent [Fushokukou] that reacts like acid to anything that it touches; and acceleration scent [Kasokukou] that doubles her physical speed each time she uses it, at great risk to her own health.",

Only his last name, Makube, is known, for it was written on the bag itself. He later came to be known as MakubeX, the 'x' symbolizing an unknown variable, and his \"name\" is always written in romaji. MakubeX is a genius hacker, capable of manipulating computers to do whatever he pleases. He was originally taught by Gen but swiftly surpassed him in skill.\n\r\nHe was raised by Gen, whom he calls Grandfather, but left home to join the VOLTS. During the VOLTS's rule of Infinity Fortress, he was one of the \"Four Kings\", alongside Shido Fuyuki, Fuuchouin Kazuki, and Masaki Kurusu. After Ginji Amano left the fortress, he, as the only one of the Four Kings remaining, took over, instituting a dictatorial rule; he was known at this period as the \"young demon king\".\n\r\nDuring the 'Infinity Fortress' arc, the GetBackers are hired to retrieve the mysterious 'IL' from him. It is later discovered that IL is in fact a computer disc containing important data required for producing an atomic bomb. (however, IL is also a short form for \"implosion lens\", one of the most crucial parts of an implosion-type nuclear weapon). The arc ends with his reconciliation with Ginji, who acknowledges the transfer of power.\n\r\nMakubeX's second-in-command is Sakura Kakei. In the IL arc, his four chief subordinates were Juubei Kakei, Haruki Emishi, Takuma Fudo, and Kyoji Kagami; Fudou vanished afterwards, but Juubei and Emishi remained with him. In the manga, after the Divine Design arc, Toshiki Uryuu came under him; he assigned the newcomer to his old comrade, Juubei.",

She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency)  since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by the eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit's power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. \n\r\nRobin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.\n\r\nRobin is actually an archaeologist of talent, and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons, and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.\n\r\nRobin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat's Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world, and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool. This trait makes her different from the other Straw Hats, who often comically react melodramatically to unexpected happenings and hold irrational ideas and conclusions. Despite her attempts to keep herself distant, Robin has fallen for her new friends, and has taken the role of the distant den mother.",

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style).This is achieved by using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head. \n\r\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood.\n\r\nZoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but, unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.\n\r\nZoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined.",

She is evidently Edward's love interest. Specializing in mechanical repair, specifically with automail, Winry services Edward's arm and leg whenever it is in need of repair or replacement.\n\nIn the manga, Winry becomes an apprentice to Garfiel, an automail engineer in Rush Valley. She also studies techniques for making automail for northern frigid conditions. Her parents, both doctors, were killed by Scar during the Ishbal war when she was very young. In chapter 47 at the Central, she tried to shoot Scar after finding out that he was the one who had killed her parents.\n\r\nShe frequently travels with the Elrics in earlier chapters and later, returning back to Rush Valley, realizes that she has been in love with Ed for a long time, and Ed has the same feeling though he constantly denies it.\n\r\nIt has been mentioned in chapter 15 that Alphonse and Edward had once fought over who would get to marry Winry when they were kids, making Ed freak out and become incredibly flustered, claiming that he didn't remember that. Alphonse won, but was rejected. After Ed asked her why, she replied with \"I don't like guys shorter than me,\" resulting in a huge blow on Ed's ego.\n\nDue to her importance in the lives of the Elric brothers, Winry is used as a hostage by the military to gain Edward's obedience. In order to escape from the military possession, she decided to travel with Scar and the others. It was revealed in chapter 73 that it was her plan for Scar to use her as a hostage in order to escape although she has not forgiven him for killing her parents. In chapter 84 Winry is taken on a military train back into Resembool in a water tank. When she goes into her house, she is shocked to find Ed in her room while she is undressing. They both scream which causes everyone to believe that the two of them are in danger. Shortly afterwards (after beating his head a few times), she fills Ed in on where Al is and what have been happening in Lior. Ed tells her to leave the country, but she refuses, wanting to help Ed in any way that she can. Ed soon departs, and Winry stays in Resembool for the time being.\n\r\nAt the epilogue, Ed confesses (or maybe more like proposes) to her, and in a photo, it shown that they're married and have two children.",

Izumi tried and failed to revive the child through human transmutation (an act that created Wrath in the first anime). The failed attempt took some of her internal organs, resulting in infertility, and causing her to periodically cough up blood. Izumi gained the ability to use alchemy without a transmutation circle after seeing the \"truth.\"\n\nIn the manga, Izumi attracts the attention of the State Military for surviving the failed human transmutation. As she and her husband travel around Amestris in order to avoid the military, they eventually meet Ed and Al's father Hohenheim. He rearranges her insides to ease the blood flow, and persuades her to help collaborate in bringing down the State Military.",

    "description": "Height: 5'8\" (173 cm) \n\r\nRoy Mustang is the \"Flame Alchemist,\" having absolute control over heat and fire through alchemy. Using special gloves that create a spark when he snaps his fingers, Roy can create anything from a tiny ember to burn a letter, to a raging inferno that can destroy a humanoid body in seconds. His precise control over the alchemically enhanced flame is so accurate that he can boil the water in a persons' eyes and can also attack enemies amongst a riot without hurting any allies.\n\r\nOutwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and almost always one step ahead of his opponents, and likes to feel in control of the situation. He is one of the superiors of Edward Elric. On the surface, he appears to be nothing more than a man of the military who pursues promotions and praise and is considered a ladies' man who constantly goes on dates with different women. Mustang's true goal is to become F\u00fchrer in order to gain the power to reform the government in order to absolve his sins in the Ishval War as well as change the country for the better, along with the joking requirement for female officers to wear tiny miniskirts (which considerably increased Havoc's loyalty to him and caused Hawkeye to be angry with him). \n\r\nHis goals are admirable enough that he earns the fierce loyalty of his good friends Lt Col. Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, and his own subordinates, among whom are Riza Hawkeye, Jean Havoc, Heymans Breda, Vato Falman, and Kain Fuery. While Mustang has a close and amicable relationship with all of his subordinates, he appears to share a deeper bond of affection with his second-in-command Riza Hawkeye, who has devoted her life to supporting him. This bond culminates in the final episodes of the anime when Mustang chooses Hawkeye alone to accompany him on his greatest and most dangerous mission. \n\r\nThough a hero of the Ishval War, he remains haunted by the horrors of war and suffers great remorse for the lives he took. \n\nAfter the Promised Day arrives, he is forced to open the gate by Pride and Wrath, they first try to make him do it voluntarily by reviving Hawkeye, but he refuses. So Pride opens the gate for him using his Philosopher's Stone. Mustang gains the power to transmute without a circle, however his price is his eyesight.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "Birthday: September 15\r\nHoroscope: Virgo\r\nBlood Type: O\r\nHeight: 5\"11\"\r\nWeight: 67.5 kg \r\nHair: Silver\r\nEyes: Grey, Sharingan\r\nRank: Jonin, Former ANBUHokage\r\nLikes: Icha-Icha series, Broiled Saury with salt, Miso soup with eggplant\r\nDislikes: Anything sweet\r\nQuote: (from Obito) \"A shinobi who violates the rules is scum, but a shinobi who abandons their friends is worse than scum\".\n\r\nMajor Background SpoilersLike his father, Sakumo Hatake whose skills have been compared to that of the Legendary Ninja, Kakashi is considered a genius shinobi, graduating from the Ninja Academy at age 5 and achieving the rank of Chunin at 6. A few years after these accomplishments, Kakashi's father was disgraced by the village for abandoning a mission in favor of saving his comrades, which cost the Land of Fire dearly. Deeply ashamed and ostracized even by those he had saved, Sakumo committed seppuku, leaving Kakashi to bear witness to the event. After his father's suicide, Kakashi began to adhere strictly to the rules of the shinobi \u2013 in particular the rule dictating that the success of the mission must come before the well being of one's teammates, causing him to become arrogant, humorless, and by-the-book.\n\r\nDuring an attempt to save Rin, Kakashi lost his left eye as a result of taking an enemy ninja's attack for Obito. To protect Kakashi in return, Obito managed to awaken his Sharingan and killed their assailant. Soon after saving Rin, a rockfall technique was triggered and a rock struck Kakashi on his blind side. He would have been buried beneath the rocks had Obito not pushed Kakashi out of the way, getting the right side of his body almost completely crushed in the process. Shortly before he died, Obito had Rin (a medical ninja) implant his Sharingan eye in Kakashi's damaged eye socket as a gift. As his first act with his new eye, Kakashi avenged Obito by killing the enemy ninja with his now-perfected Chidori technique, bringing the Kakashi of today into being.\n\r\nYears later Kakashi would become a member of the Konohagakure ANBU where he served as a squad leader. During this time, he had several k\u014dhai, named Yugao Uzuki and Tenzo, and recognized the latter as the most successful of his k\u014dhai. It is unknown when or why he left ANBU, but he still wears iron guards on his gloves, a characteristic of ANBU uniforms.\n\r\nObito's death profoundly changed Kakashi, and Kakashi adopted many of Obito's traits. One such trait was Obito's concept of teamwork, which is most clearly seen in the way Kakashi tests newly-graduated students hoping to become a squad under him. He uses the bell test to test his students, which requires the three students to get the two bells he keeps on his person. Only those who get a bell get to pass, which would be difficult even with teamwork, as at least one ninja would fail regardless. However, the rule is only a ruse; the point of the test is to foster teamwork and to teach the students that teamwork is more important than the rules. Team 7 is the only team to realize this, and as such becomes the only team Kakashi passes into Genin-status. Kakashi also inherits Obito's chronic tardiness, due primarily to losing track of time during his frequent visits to Konoha's memorial site, where Obito's name is engraved. Ironically, this very habit is one that Kakashi was often annoyed at Obito about. Obito was supposedly late due to random good deeds. Kakashi's personal life appears to be as much of a mystery as the face behind the mask he has worn for most of his ninja career. He has no living family, or at least none he cares to acknowledge, and he's confirmed that everyone he loves is already dead.\r\nKakashi has an ongoing, albeit slightly one-sided, rivalry with Might Guy, with Guy constantly proclaiming that Kakashi is his rival, and considering his and Kakashi's subordinates rivals. Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and Kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. Given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on Guy's part. Nevertheless, Guy is proud of his record.\n\r\nThough he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"Icha Icha Paradise\" (\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally \"Make Out Paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally \"Make Out Violence\"). In Part II Naruto gives him the new \"Icha Icha Tactics\" (\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30bf\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally \"Make Out Tactics\").\n\r\nKakashi's Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent's movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi's use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. In Part II Kakashi is able to develop his own Mangekyo Sharingan. With his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another's arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. Much like the standard Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan tires Kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.\n\r\nWith his Sharingan Kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\". As a result, Kakashi's arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. Many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. He does, however, use Water Release: Water Encampment Wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. He less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique to attack opponents or Earth Release: Inner Decapitation Technique (\u571f\u9041\u30fb\u5fc3\u4e2d\u65ac\u9996\u306e\u8853, Doton: Shinj\u016b Zanshu no Jutsu, Viz \"Groundhog Technique Decapitation\", English TV \"Headhunter Jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. He can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks Naruto's chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.\n\r\nWhile Kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his Sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique (\u9b54\u5e7b\u30fb\u5948\u70d9\u898b\u306e\u8853, Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. A Thousand Years of Pain (death in english dub) (\u5343\u5e74\u6bba\u3057, Sennen Goroshi) consists of Kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent's rectum. While only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.\n\r\nWhen he was younger Kakashi was taught how to use the Rasengan by the Fourth Hokage. Because the Rasengan is meant to have the user's chakra nature mixed with it, Kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In time he instead created the Chidori, his only original jutsu. After the jutsu's initial creation Kakashi was unable to use the Chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. After acquiring the Sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. Through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, Kakashi's Chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the Lightning Blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it.",

He is the son of Gendo and the late Yui Ikari. Abandoned by his father, Gendo, when he was a toddler, Shinji often ran away from difficult situations. As a pilot, he panics easily and reacts very poorly to unexpected events. Over time and with encouragement from Misato, he learns to be less cowardly, more outspoken, and more confident.\n\nHis progress is all undone when he is forced to kill the only person who ever openly expressed love toward him. His only friends are Toji and Kensuke, but he apparently cares about Rei more than even he realizes, although everyone around him seems to think that his feelings are obvious. Despite his rapport with Rei, Asuka is a sexual presence in his life, and is ultimately shown to be a figure of great emotional importance to him as well. Though not immediately apparent, their relationship is a powerful driving force for both characters throughout the series. Their confused, back-and-forth emotional interchanges are a source of considerable guilt and tension for both parties. While Asuka is attracted to Shinji, she is afraid to admit to being dependent on anyone; so instead of expressing affection, she teases Shinji (often with sexual overtones), hoping to \"provoke\" him into initiating a closer relationship. Significantly, she gives him his first kiss (supposedly out of boredom, though the Director's Cut makes clear that the kiss meant a lot more to her than she lets on). However, due to his own emotional issues, Shinji is unable to recognize Asuka's actions for their true intent, and is only confused and hurt by her flirting mixed with abuse. \n\r\nSince Asuka is constantly heaping him with accusations and blame, his most natural response is to withdraw and hide himself, both emotionally and literally. To make matters worse, Asuka only finds herself more and more frustrated by Shinji's failure to respond to her advances, and in turn only abuses him more and more harshly, which only makes him withdraw further, thus continuing the vicious cycle. Their tense relationship reaches a breaking point toward the end of the story; when Asuka's stress finally causes her to degrade into a completely withdrawn state, Shinji tries to comfort her, only to be coldly rejected.\nLater on, when Asuka has further been reduced to a comatose state and Shinji has also suffered incredible mental duress, he goes to her bedside to beg for help, only to end up masturbating over her partially nude (and comatose) body. Wracked with guilt and completely lost to his own self-hatred, he enters a completely withdrawn state, not unlike Asuka's earlier on.\n\r\nUltimately, when Shinji chooses to reject Instrumentality, he finds Asuka to be the only other person on Earth, and they painfully reconcile.\r\n(Source: Afufu)",

Witnessing the maturity of Hikaru, Sai finds out that his one-thousand-year time in the world is going to finish and can't fulfill the wish of obtaining the divine move. A few days after the game with Toya Meijin, Sai suddenly disappears, neither terminating his last match with Hikaru nor saying goodbye to him. Sai leaves Hikaru forever, leaving Hikaru depressed and wanting to quit go. Hikaru then realizes that he will continue to play go for Sai since Sai influenced him to play go.\r\nExtremely effeminate by today's standards (as is appropriate for a high-born Heian man), Sai is often drawn with traditionally feminine features and mannerisms. Yumi Hotta has joked about fans mistakenly calling him a \"she\" in the \"intermission\" pages of the manga. Sai's extremely emotional behavior is also proper for a Heian male; he sometimes cries copiously, soaking his long sleeves with tears, which in his own time would be respected as a sign of intelligence and sensitivity. His name Fujiwara indicates that he is related to a noble family of extremely high prestige in the Heian period, the Fujiwara clan.",

Heero is known as \"The Perfect Soldier,\" having been trained since he was very young for the battlefield.\n\r\nHeero Yuy is nothing more than his code name, however, named for the fallen Colony leader who's assassination the Gundam Pilots were supposed to avenge.\n\r\nAfter his arrival on Earth, Heero encounters Relena Darlian, the daughter of an Earth/Colony peace advocate. After enrolling in her school, Heero ends up saving her life on several occasions, causing him to confuse his mission and his feelings.\n\r\nHeero's first ally is Duo Maxwell, who helps him pull his Gundam up from the ocean. Afterwards, he sets out on his own for a while, attacking bases and OZ encampments.\n\r\nHis primary rival is Zechs Merquise, and they have several battles throughout the series, even trading Gundams from time to time. His other rival is Treize Kushrenada, who gives him the purely evil Gundam Epyon, which he trades to Zechs for the Wing Zero.\n\r\nAlthough Trowa Barton holds the most mystery to his personality, Heero comes a close second, always disappearing after completing a mission or having an encounter. He lives by his emotions as stated by himself several times within the series and always thinks things through most of the time.  He was also referred to as \"the heart of space\" by Quatre Raberba Winner, Pilot 04, near the end of the last episode.  \n\r\nIn Frozen Teardrop\n\r\nAt an unspecified date, Heero is cryogenically frozen by Preventer  and stored at the Mars Preventer base. Given the code name 'Sleeping Beauty/Princess Aurora' due to the appearance of his capsule, he remains there for decades until he is awoken in MC (Mars Colony) 0022, when he is awoken to participate in Operation Mythos.\n\r\nAfter awakening, Heero is approached by Master Chang and Father Maxwell, who ask him to fight again in one last mission. For this purpose he becomes partners with Duo Maxwell and becomes the pilot of the 'Snow White', vowing to kill Relena once again. \n\r\n(Source: animefu.com)",

His bragging about his strength hides his insecurity; after each loss he is known to disappear into the restroom for long periods of time. Akira tutors him to find out about Hikaru's current strength. Ochi is unnerved by Hikaru because Akira's obsession about him seems to suggest there is more to Hikaru than what Ochi knows. Ochi is also angry that Akira acknowledges Hikaru as a rival, but not Ochi himself. He demands that Akira view him as a rival if he can defeat Hikaru in the pro exam. Ochi loses to Hikaru, but does pass the pro exam. He comes from a wealthy family, as evidenced by the number of pros that come to his household to tutor him privately in go.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He persists in offering his friendship to the initially hostile Heero, eventually winning his antisocial comrade's trust through sheer persistence. But despite his friendly nature, Duo earns his \"God of Death\" nickname when he takes on Alliance and OZ soldiers in battle.\n\r\nPrior to Operation Meteor, Duo was part of the spacegoing salvage organization known as the Sweeper Group, and on Earth he is assisted by the Sweepers' seafaring kinsfolk. When there is a lull in the fighting, Duo happily returns to his salvage-merchant's trade. He is distinguished by his black wardrobe, his yard-long plait and his minister's collar.\n\r\nIn Frozen Teardrop\n\r\nAfter Hilde breaks up with him in MC0012, Duo travels to Mars. Getting into a terrible motorbike accident in MC0014, most of his limbs are fractured, however he is aided by Trowa Barton. Once out of the hospital, saddled with debts, he meets Hilde again, who has become a librarian in the Lanigreen Republic. After moving in with her, he begins to work to earn money to fix his motorbike, and proposes to Hilde. The two are married in MC0015, and he cuts his braid off. However, he soon leaves again, taking off into the Martian wilderness. When he returns in MC0016, Hilde has become a nun at a local church orphanage. When the priest of the church bequeaths it to them, the debts of the church are also passed on to the two, as their assets were shared in marriage- the brunt of which fall to Hilde, and so she demands a divorce from Duo, who has also incurred many debts. He accepts the divorce, but not before promising to help pay off her debts. When he returns again in MC0017 NEXT SUMMER, he discovers a child whom is also named Duo Maxwell  and closely resembles him living at the orphanage, although it is not clear if the child is his biological son or not- he denies it aloud, but inwardly muses that the child would have been born in the time of his absence after marrying Hilde.\n\r\nDuring this time, he remains a close contact and ally of the Preventers. In MC0022 NEXT WINTER, he comes to the Mars Preventer base at the request of Master Chang, the head of the base, bringing the younger Duo, whom he refers to as his son, with him. He introduces himself as only 'Father Maxwell' to Preventer agent Kathy Po and reveals that he and Master Chang were once the legendary Gundam pilots named Duo Maxwell and Chang Wufei. He seems to have been training his son to take part in the upcoming Operation Mythos, and he and Duo are present for the reawakening of Heero Yuy from cold sleep, him being the first one to greet Heero upon his awakening.",

When asked by his young look-alike Trowa Phobos  what the T in his name stands for, he first answers 'Trowa', but later concedes that it stands for 'Triton', confirming other series materials which indicate that Trowa is Catherine Bloom's long-lost brother.",

Near the beginning of the series she was engaged to Athrun Zala through an arranged marriage. Though (reporting to the drama CD) the two were in love when they first met, their feelings diminished as time went on and the engagement became more political then ever before.\n\r\nThe pink-haired princess enters the series when she is traveling in a civilian vessel for a memorial ceremony on Junius Seven. The ship is mistaken for a ZAFT military aircraft, and is attacked by the Earth Alliance. Lacus is escorted to a lifepod, and escapes safely. Shortly thereafter, Lacus' escape pod is discovered by Kira in the Strike. He brings the pod back to the Archangel.\n\r\nThe doors to the life pod open and out hops a small, pink, robotic ball. Following after it is Lacus Clyne herself in a bit of dismay that she was saved by Earth forces. Despite being enemies, the girl is cheery and kind to everyone on the ship as they keep her hostage. ZAFT forces discover the Archangel, and a battle breaks out. Before the Earth Alliance can suffer more loss, Natarle Badgiruel opens a channel to the enemy. It is then revealed to ZAFT that Lacus Clyne, the famous idol, is onboard the Archangel.\n\r\nKira is distraught and, due to Flay's abusive words, comes direly close to an emotional breakdown; however, Lacus attempts to comfort him. The couple find that they both know Athrun Zala on a personal level, and even that Athrun made Lacus' Haro/Pink-chan (her pink, robotic ball) and Kira's Torii (his flying bird robot). Kira decides to return Lacus to where she belongs with Athrun.\n\r\nEven before meeting Kira, Lacus had an indirect influence on the war. She spread her opinion throughout PLANT by singing a song of peace, her lyrics filled with the hope of harmony between the nations. After encountering the Archangel, she expresses a larger need to achieve peace by aiding Kira many more times, causing Athrun to question his purpose for taking part in the war, and much more. In time, she ends up falling in love with Kira (which is seen much more clearly in Gundam Seed Destiny), and Athrun & her engagement is ended without quarrel.",

    "description": "Birthday: September 1, CE 57\r\nBirthplace: ORB \r\nAge: GSD16, GSMovie18\r\nBlood-type: O \r\nHeight: 168cm, 173cm\r\nWeight: 55kg \r\nMemorable Belongings: His deceased younger sister Mayu's cell phone \r\nMobile Suit: ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam, ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam\n\r\nShinn is the first protagonist introduced, but later conflict pits him against the established protagonists of the original Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. Thus, he serves in both the \"hero\" and \"villain\" roles at different points of the story.\n\r\nShinn lives with his parents and his younger sister in the neutral country of Orb, but the Earth Alliance attacks Orb on June 15. Only Shinn survives when his family is caught in a crossfire between the GAT-X131 Calamity and the ZGMF-X10A Freedom mobile suits, though it is not clear whether the Calamity or the Freedom was responsible for the explosion that kills Shinn's family. Shinn blames Orb\u2019s rulers, the Athhas, for his family\u2019s deaths, believing that they should have surrendered to the attacking Earth Alliance Forces rather than endangering civilians in a battle that could not be won. Since then, he had a lust for revenge and hated ORB and their \"sugarcoated\" ideals of achieving peace without any weapons, etc.  Orb soldier Captain Todaka then takes care of Shinn and later sends him to the PLANTs, where he joins ZAFT and graduates as one of the top students in his class as a \"ZAFT Red\".\n\r\nAfter graduation, Shinn is assigned to pilot ZAFT's ZGMF-X56S Impulse, and is stationed aboard the battleship Minerva under the command of Talia Gladys along with former military academy classmates Rey Za Burrel, Vino Dupre, Lunamaria Hawke, Meyrin Hawke, and Yolant Kent. Even though the bitter end of his family happened in the past, he has never forgotten it and constantly has reoccuring flashbacks of that time including the good memories he has of his sister.",

    "description": "During the Armory One Incident, Lunamaria, along with Shinn and Rey, is drawn into the conflict, but the stolen units escape and are picked up by the mirage colloid\u2013cloaked Earth Alliance battleship Girty Lue, waiting outside the colony. The Minerva pursues the Girty Lue, engaging in several battles.\n\r\nDuring the pursuit, Lunamaria meets former ZAFT member Athrun Zala, who is using the alias \"Alex Dino\" and acting as Cagalli Yula Athha\u2019s bodyguard. Lunamaria's interest in Athrun grows when he re-enlists in ZAFT as a member of FAITH and joins the crew of the Minerva. Her attempts to get closer to Athrun are sometimes thwarted by Lacus Clyne impersonator, Meer Campbell. Ironically, Lunamaria appears not to notice her own sister Meyrin's interest in Athrun, even when the two discuss him.\n\r\nLater, Talia Gladys, captain of the Minerva, orders her to spy on Athrun when he meets with his former comrades Kira Yamato and Cagalli from the Archangel. During this meeting, Lunamaria discovers that the Lacus she knows is an impostor. She gives the data and photographs she collected to Talia, but omits mentioning that the Lacus Clyne working for PLANT is not the true Lacus. There are times when she appears to want to discuss the matter with Shinn, but she would not when Rey is around.\n\r\nThe Minerva participates in several incidents during the Second Bloody Valentine War. During the Battle of Crete, Lunamaria\u2019s ZAKU Warrior is heavily damaged and she is badly wounded. Upon the Minerva's arrival at Gibraltar, Lunamaria has recovered and replaces Shinn as pilot of the ZGMF-X56S Impulse, since he is now piloting the ZGMF-X42S Destiny.\n\r\nLunamaria is shocked when she is informed that Athrun and her sister Meyrin have defected together and that Shinn has destroyed the GOUF Ignited in which the pair had attempted to escape. In grief and denial, Lunamaria places the blame on Logos rather than Shinn, who is clearly upset over killing her sister. Lunamaria and Shinn begin relying on each other for emotional support and develop a romantic relationship.\n\r\nAfter Operation: Fury, Lunamaria discovers that both Athrun and Meyrin are alive and on the rogue battleship, Archangel. At the Battle of Messiah, Lunamaria refrains from attacking the Eternal, when she discovers Meyrin is on that ship.\n\r\nLunamaria then battles Athrun, blaming him for taking her sister Meyrin away. He badly damages Lunamaria's mobile suit, the Impulse, with his ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice. Because Lunamaria is getting beaten, Shinn enters SEED Mode and attacks Athrun with his ZGMF-X42S Destiny. Lunamaria interposes herself between the two, trying to get them to stop fighting. Shinn is too enraged to understand what Lunamaria has done, but Athrun enters SEED Mode, blocks Shinn's attack, and saves Lunamaria. Athrun then cripples Shinn's mobile suit and Shinn crashes on the surface of the moon. Lunamaria lands her damaged Impulse nearby and ends up holding a tearful Shinn in her arms, as they watch the Requiem superweapon explode and then the ZAFT fortress, Messiah, crash into the Moon.\n\r\nIn Gundam SEED Destiny \"Final Plus\", both stranded pilots are later rescued by Athrun Zala in the Infinite Justice. At the end of \"Final Plus\", Lunamaria is present with Shinn (alongside Athrun and Meyrin, Kira and Lacus) as he pays tribute to his deceased family in Orb.",

    "name": "Sakura ",
    "description": "Age: 14\n\r\nAt the start of the series in both manga and anime, Sakura is the princess of the Kingdom of Clow who has feelings for Syaoran, her childhood friend.\n\r\nWhen she is about to confess her feelings, a mysterious force causes her own dormant magical powers to manifest in the form of feathered wings. When her feathers are scattered across time and space, Syaoran vows to recover all of them because each feather represents a memory Sakura has had since birth and are connected to her heart; without the feathers, she will die.\n\r\nFei-Wong Reed (the mysterious villain in the series) reflects on the ability of people like the High Priest Yukito, Princess Tomoyo of Nihon, and Y\u016bko to cross dimensions and comments that the power concealed within Sakura and the ruins in Clow Country surpasses them all.\n\r\nIn order to cross dimensions, Sakura must pay Y\u016bko the thing most important to her and she pays Y\u016bko in an indirect way but her price is pretty much the same as Syaoran - her memories of him. When she awakes in the Hanshin Republic the first person she sees is Syaoran, but she does not remember anything about him, asking \"Who are you?\"\n\r\nAt times, such as in \u014cuto, Sakura comes extremely close to remembering Syaoran but it is quickly erased once more from her memory. Syaoran, having known this would happen previously, will never tell her anything about their previous relationship. At most, all Sakura knows about Syaoran is what she has relearned from the adventures together with Mokona, Fai, and Kurogane, although she knows she knew him previously and he was very important to her. It is also clear that she is falling in love with him once more.\n\r\nSakura possesses unnaturally good luck; both Chun Hyang and Y\u016bko call her \"a favored daughter of the gods\". This is what allowed her to travel dimensions safely until Y\u016bko asks for her good luck as a price. According to Yukito and Syaoran, Sakura also has the ability to \"hear\" the voices of those who cannot be heard, such as spirits of nature, and to see ghosts. Such as the time in the Country of Jade, she can see Princess Emeraude while others couldn't. She can also see the future in visions, though this ability is unreliable and nothing she has control over.\n\r\nSakura's personality is passive and weary, exhausted from her loss of memories. However as the series goes on, she becomes more stronger and independent. Syaoran states, even though she's lost most of her memories, she'll never change. She helps the group whenever she can, whether it's washing dishes or saving their lives.\n\nHowever, later in the manga, her personality undergoes a change after the clone Syaoran leaves her. As she voices to  Fai, no matter how identical the two Syaorans may be, the real Syaoran is still not the one she knows. Subsequent chapters show Sakura with a much darker personality, accompanied with gothic clothing.\n\r\nIn the Infinity Arc, the group spent a few months fighting in a tournament, supposedly wanting to use the prize money to restore a world the clone Syaoran destroyed. However, the truth is that she was after the real prize - a robot (who is identical to Freya from Chobits) who can let one person and one person alone travel across dimensions.\n\r\nIt is later revealed that Fai is under a curse that forces him to kill if he ever meets a person that is stronger than him. And in volume one, you can see that Y\u016bko was not hit by the rain, nor did she touch any of the people directly; this was because she was in another dimension to prevent Fai's curse from being activated. But when Sakura receives two feathers in the Infinity Arc, she was made stronger than Fai's halved magic and so he stabbed her, seemingly possessed. Sakura had a vision that after killing her, he would go insane and kill everyone else, eventually committing suicide, but she used the robot to transport her soul to a dream world, thus saving herself and stopping Fai from going insane.\n\r\nLater, it's revealed that she was not the original target of the curse, as the real Syaoran was. This is explained further in her appearance in xxxHolic; she changed the future so that Syaoran would not be killed. As she explains to Watanuki (Xxxholic chapter 140), her coldness to the real Syaoran was because she was trying to follow the dream as close as possible up to that near fatal event. It's later learned that Sakura can still be saved. The two places where her body and her soul went contains two feathers. Her soul went to the world of dreams, where it will be aided by the other Syaoran. So the real Syaoran, Fai, Mokona and Kurogane went to Celes Country to rescue the body of Sakura, as Y\u016bko told them it's the body they should rescue first, then the soul.\n\r\nAt the end of the manga, her soul is eventually killed by the clone Syaoran, but just before her death, she reveals that she is a clone of the real Sakura. Her purpose was to map out other dimensions for Fei Wang, who created her, by finding the feathers. She is reincarnated in the original Sakura's body in the past, with her memories intact by Y\u016bko, along with the clone Syaoran. In this life she is friends with Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, of the Magic Knights. Syaoran and Sakura eventually meet and give birth to a boy, who turns out to be the original Syaoran.  They raise him until it is time for him to begin the events of the series, and then they are sealed in a glass tube in order to await the time where Reed attempts to shatter reality. Sakura and Syaoran, after breaking free from the tube, cleanse the feathers, but both ultimately disappear after Kurogane kills Fei Wong, leaving behind only a feather which Sakura's original absorbs.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, CLAMP Wikia)",

Shortly after their birth, the second prince died, and their mother committed suicide out of guilt for giving birth to them. In addition, the country suffered many misfortunes, and the twins, when combined, bore powerful magic that rivaled that of the current king.\n\nThe king decided that making Yuui and Fai unhappy was the only way to break the \"curse\", and since both twins refused to kill each other, they were locked up separately in a place where magic is ineffective and time does not flow: a tower residing in a deep valley; Fai was imprisoned atop the tower, and Yuui was confined at the base of the tower. Both were condemned to stay there \"until the world's destruction.\"\n\nDespite their unhappiness, the number of bodies dumped into the base of the tower began to grow. Yuui tried endlessly to climb up towards Fai, so they could escape, but he did not succeed. Eventually, the King became insane, and he executed every person in the country, Beside's Yuui and Fai. He then jumped into the valley himself and committing suicide in front of a horrified Yuui, reminding him that their birth was the reason for the country's misfortune, and that they would now \"pay for that sin\" by being the only people alive in Valeria.\n\nEventually, Fei Wong Reed appeared from another world, and offered to free one of them. Fai chose to save Yuui, resulting in Fai being thrown from the tower to his death. Fei Wong then convinced Yuui that he was the cause of Fai's death and that Fai might be revived if Yuui agrees on becoming Fei Wong Reed's pawn.\n\nAfter meeting Ashura, Yuui took up the name of his dead brother as his own. The body of real Fai was kept underwater in Celes castle by Yuui. It is also revealed that Yuui is in posession of two of  Sakura's feathers. One feather Yuui kept intill he met Sakura so that she woulden't die as soon as she lost her memories. The other feather Yuui used to create his assisstant, Chii. Chii was meant to be a compainion for Fai seince Yuui new he woulden't alway's be in Valeria, And also so Fai's body would not continue decaying. Chii was also created to look like Yuui and Fai's mother.\n\nAshura placed a flourite with Fai the same time that he gave Yuui the name of flourite and it was later reviled that it held one of Sakura's feathers inside it. \nIn Horitsuba Gakuen, he is the twin brother of Fai (in Horitsuba Gakuen) and is a chef from Italy.",

    "name": "Kurogane ",
    "description": "His compassion and protective nature is especially clear when his actions early in the series are compared to his actions later on. He had straight out told Syaoran in their first world, the Hanshin Republic, that the quest has nothing at all to do with him. In the next world they visit (Koryo Country) however, Kurogane offers his services to help raid the castle of an evil lord, and stays behind in battle to let Syaoran go on ahead. Eventually, he risks a loss in strength to avenge his comrades' \"death\" (they were of course still alive) by defeating their killer in battle. It is noted that after he finds out Fai and Syaoran are still alive, he lost his passion for the battle.\n\r\nHe obtained a new sword in Outo called the Souhi (Blue Ice or Pale Ice) and taught Syaoran the skills of sword fighting and sensing attacks from the left. \n\nAt the beginning of the story, Kurogane told Syaoran that he would not help in finding Sakura's feathers, since it was not related to him. However, he ended up aiding Syaoran and the others anyway, teaching Syaoran how to fight and use a sword as well.\n\r\nIn the Tokyo arc, Kurogane was involved in a short fight with Kamui. Later, he wished to Yuuko to save Fai's life, after Fai's eye was ripped out by the clone Syaoran. Through an arrangement by Yuuko, Kurogane and Kamui mixed their blood and forced Fai to drink it. Fai thus became a vampire and survived. Since it was not Fai's wish to live but Kurogane's, Fai can only take blood from Kurogane. Fai painfully refrained from calling Kurogane nicknames from then on, in an effort to distance himself from Kurogane.\n\r\nKurogane noticed that Fai and Sakura were up to something in the Infinity world, but did not say anything. After Sakura left, however, he finally spoke up, refusing to let Fai give up his eyesight to go to Celes. Kurogane told Yuuko they would all pay a fourth of the price to go save Sakura's body from Celes.\n\r\nIn the latter parts of Volume 20, Ashura used his magic to show Syaoran, Kurogane, and Mokona visions of Fai's tragic past. This caused an angry and betrayed Kurogane to unsheathe his sword and attack Ashura and Fai. He and Fai fought a fierce battle that devastated the room around them. In the mayhem, Kurogane destroyed the body of Fai's twin and managed to overpower Fai in that moment of weakness, saying to the overpowered Fai something along the lines of \"I thought I already told you I don't have anything to do with your past\". Kurogane then turned on Ashura, demanding to know why he'd shown them Fai's memories. The king responded by saying that he only wanted Fai to \"grant his wish\" and kill him. Ashura then launched vicious spells against Fai, Kurogane, Syaoran, Mokona, and a defenseless Sakura's body in order to force Fai's hand. In the chaos that followed, one of the massive ice stagamites that he conjured pierced Kurogane through his lower right side.\n\r\nKorogane is then apparently spared the damage due to the protective spell that placed upon him before leaving Japan by Tomoyo. He then stabs King Ashura, and after the King's death the group is seen possibly leaving for the next world.\n\r\nFai's second curse caused him to suck up the world of Ceres; Fai tries to transport Kurogane and the others out of the small sphere that Ceres has become, but he doesn't have enough magic to do so. He only succeeds in transporting Syaoran, Sakura, and Mokona. Then Mokona's earring (a magical tool made by Yuuko) was able to drill a hole into the sphere, but only one person could pass through. When Fai told Kurogane to leave him, Kurogane cut off his left arm and left it and Souhi as a sacrifice and rescued Fai.\n\r\nIn chapter 167, Kurogane wakes up and finds himself back in his country, with Princess Tomoyo by his bed. Tomoyo welcomes Kurogane home and asks him if he has found out the true meaning of strength, to which he replies that he doesn't know. However, he explains to Tomoyo that he doesn't regret giving up his arm to take Fai with him, and tells her that he knows that some things can't be protected only by (physical) strength. This surprises Tomoyo, but she acknowledges that Kurogane has definitely realized the true meaning of strength. She then lets Fai into Kurogane's room. Kurogane seems genuinely pleased to see Fai, while Fai doesn't express much emotion, until suddenly he punches Kurogane. Kurogane doesn't quite react to this, far too startled. Fai then smiles at him, saying \"This is payback, Kuro-sama.\" The smile seems like the real thing, and Fai has gone back to using suffixes on Kurogane's name. Kurogane grins back, promising to beat Fai up for that.\n\r\nIn chapter 169, Kurogane is approached by Fuuma who has come to Nihon Country with an artificial arm from Piffle Country, however Kurogane refuses the arm by saying that he \"will not pay anything to that witch for it.\" Fai replies by saying that he had agreed to pay the price while he slept, and gives up the last of his magic. In the second to last page of 169, Kurogane is seen with the arm attached, but claims that it \"feels weird.\"\r\nIn Horitsuba Gakuen, he is the PE teacher.",

Unlike other humans, Koutaroh could see angels and other sort supernatural beings due to being half demon (Shia's son). Upon her sister's demand, Misha has to return to Heaven, unable to meet Koutaroh again. This causes great pain on him,making him decide to commited suicide, wanting to meet Misha there.

Though hard to see through her candy-coated exterior, Shia is actually a demon (and not a very good one at that, due to the fact she is kind-hearted and slightly weak). Shia is very domestic and excels at cooking and cleaning.\n\nIn the manga, Shia is more demon than anime: she even bites Kotarou in the neck, and causes him to almost die 2 times, the reason this being later explained that demons feel a greater attraction to their own family's blood. Demons can't survive in the human world for long, so they're forced to take the life from something else (people or animals) to continue living. To preserve her life, Shia was offered Misha's blood, both of them not knowing an angel's lifeforce is actually poisonous to demons, so Shia's life was being shortened in the long run. Shia didn't also say farewell to everyone, she only said them to Ayanokoji. In the manga, it is later revealed that she is Kotarou's great-grandmother. In the book 7, she uses her last powers and dies to the train station, right as she started considering her new life with her memory restored.

    "name": "Saito Hiraga",
    "description": "Height: 172 cm (5'8\")\r\nBirthday: December 9th\r\nFavorite Food: Teriyaki Burgers\r\nHobbies: The Internet\r\nSpecial Skills: Good with Action Games, Swordsmanship \r\nHates: His P.E. Teacher\r\nWeapon: Delflinger (\u30c7\u30eb\u30d5\u30ea\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc), a sentient sword\n\r\nSaito Hiraga, the main male character, is from Earth (specifically Tokyo, Japan). At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara. A portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked through. At first, Saito had no idea where he was, and was thoroughly disoriented. When he arrives on the other side however he is made to sit and obey like a normal household dog. When the bond of him being her familiar, involves having a kiss with the familiar, he is quite shocked at why they do it. In the anime, he also could not identify nor understand the language the students were speaking, but after Louise attempts to cast a silence spell on him that fails, he could understand and communicate with others as though they were speaking Japanese. It is not clear whether he was actually gifted with full knowledge of their language, or whether the misfired spell was similar in principle to a universal translator. This was not the case in the light novel though, where he does understand their language; like the names of the characters, the language spoken by them is also French.\n\r\nThere are Runes inscribed into Saito's hand as a result of his being bound to Louise. They read geboundolf or Gundolf meaning Gand\u00e1lfr (\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30eb\u30f4, Gand\u0101ruvu?). These runes glow when his Gand\u00e1lfr powers activate. As a Gand\u00e1lfr, Saito has the ability to use any object that was made with the intent of being used as a weapon at an extremely high level of skill. He also becomes significantly stronger, faster and tougher. Even weapons that he had never touched before, such as an M-72 rocket launcher and a World War II Zero Fighter, can be instantly understood and utilized. This physical augmentation fades more or less instantly when he stops using the power, which can result in him falling unconscious if he'd been wounded previously. That he can only use items specifically crafted for the purpose of weapons was revealed by Derflinger after a failed attempt to use an ornamental sword. It has not been made clear whether Gand\u00e1lfr powers could be used in conjunction with purely magical weaponry such as a wand or a staff. Even with these abilities he doesn't defend himself at all against Louise's constant beatings.\n\r\nThe series constantly implies him being a pervert and sometimes he does think exactly like one, but justifiably, he is a young single guy who isn't married to anyone. Louise just enforces an ownership type arrangement over Saito implying she is owed Saito's feelings. It is later revealed that Saito has feelings for Louise and even says it openly to her.\n\r\nSaito also has a bit of a troublesome and somewhat complicated tendency of getting involved with women. Strange and oddly sexual things happen when he seemingly becomes intimate with another girl. A few examples are when Kirche or even Siesta try to gain his attention, by mostly sexual seduction. When he meets or speaks to an attractive girl, he is often only noticing her chest in a few instances . This is actually one of the main reasons why Louise treats him so poorly as he is expected to be perfect in every way in her childish mindset.\n\r\nAlthough he acts a bit perverted at times, this does not mean that he does not think of Louise. Similar to how she feels whenever he is becoming intimate with another girl (specifically with large breasts) Saito can get very upset when it comes to Louise and other men. He dislikes Julio for his \"snobbish\" interest in Louise, especially since he is adored by all the other young girls in Tristain Academy. He becomes extremely jealous and calls him a bastard whenever he tries to touch Louise or gain her attention. He also becomes upset he hears of Louise being married off to someone else. When his friends dragged him into a hole to peep at the girls while they were bathing, he was extremely protective of Louise and stopped them before they saw her naked.He uses the name \"My Louise\" several times in the light novels when he feels jealous toward other guys. This is definite evidence of his strong feelings for Louise.\n\r\nHis partner, the talking sword Derflinger, was also the partner of the Gand\u00e1lfr from six-thousand years ago. His advice and comments never reflect well on Saito. Saito protects Louise because he is her familiar, and it is later shown that he has feelings for her as well, claiming \"All that he is good at is protecting her.\" He is revealed to be a Gand\u00e1lfr, a familiar who exists to protect a Void Wizard as they cast their spells. Even when this fact becomes known to Louise, she still physically assaults him, while Saito is seen often shrugging it off as his fault. Saito was given the nickname \"Our Sword\" by the head cook in episode three, where Louise takes Saito into town to purchase a weapon for him, which happens to be the legendary sword Derflinger. By the beginning of the third series, the magical runes on Saito's hand mysteriously disappear, and Saito's position of Gand\u00e1lfr is in question. He regains them when he is re-summoned by Louise. With the return of runes, Saito is knighted for the feat of stopping an entire army by himself, and given a hero's welcome at the Academy. Saito is named after Gennai Hiraga who is an Edo period Japanese scientist, and his name is written as \"ability man.\"\n\nIn Zero no Tsukaima F, the final episode, he gets married to Louise. He also traveled back to Japan, accompanied by Louise because of her teleport magic.",

    "name": "Allen Walker",
    "description": "Birthday: Unknown, December 25 (date of adoption)\r\nHeight: 168 cm (5'6\"), now 174 cm (5'8 1/2\") \r\nWeight: 127.9 lbs (58 kg), now 123 lbs (56 kg)\r\nBlood type: O\r\nNationality: British \r\nFavorite food: Mitarashi Dango\n\r\nBack Story\n\r\nAllen is the main hero of the series. He was abandoned by his biological parents because of the supposed \"deformity\" of his left arm (which was later revealed to be caused by his Innocence). He was eventually found and adopted by a traveling performer named Mana Walker on Christmas Day. Some time later Mana died, and Allen, tormented with grief and manipulated by the Millennium Earl, turned Mana into an Akuma, hoping that his beloved surrogate father would be fully resurrected. But the Mana Akuma cursed Allen and sliced through his left eye, leaving the \"Pentacle\" \u2014 the mark of the Akuma \u2014 which scars the left side of his face. This enabled his left eye to see the souls trapped within the Akuma from then on. It was at this same moment that Allen's left arm first invoked as an Anti-Akuma weapon, which instinctively destroyed the Mana Akuma. During the course of this traumatic event, Allen's hair turned from brown into a stark white.\n\r\nAllen eventually meets Cross Marian, a General of the Black Order, who explained to Allen the ways of the Akuma and the trapped souls within them: Once a soul becomes trapped inside an Akuma, they are trapped forever; and that the only way to save one is to exorcise them from their Akuma vessel. Allen subsequently became Cross' disciple and spent the next three years with him before being sent to the Black Order to become an official exorcist. During this time, Allen was tormented by his master's constant irresponsible behavior and forced into various odd-jobs to pay off the debts that General Cross accumulated. This, coupled with Marian's womanizing ways and harsh treatment towards Allen, led to Walker fearing more than respecting his master whom he never speaks fondly of. In fact, when Jasdevi claims that Cross is like a demon, Allen denies this and instead insists that Cross is a real demon. In addition, when Jasdevi reveal that the debts Cross left to them total about 2 million yen, Allen grows demon horns, laughs at them, and calls their debts small change in comparison to his own, leaving Lavi to wonder just how much money Allen's been made to pay.\n\r\nAbilities\n\r\nIn addition to being physically fit and skilled at combat (as evident by his ability to fight and dodge Fou without the use of his Innocence), Allen has a few odd talents and skills. Because of the many debts Allen was forced into paying by Cross, he learned to play cards and gamble at a very young age, though his initial purpose was to practice his numb deformed left hand. He also learned how to cheat and win through deception and doesn't hesitate to use these tactics whenever necessary. In fact, he is quite proud of his talents. This is a stark contrast to his polite and courteous nature and often surprises his friends who wouldn't expect such a dark side to Allen and has caused them to wonder just what Cross has done to him. Walker also possesses circus abilities such as juggling and acrobatics, which he learned from traveling with Mana who was himself a circus clown by trade.\n\r\nAllen's synchronization ratio reached a maximum of 83% before having his Innocence destroyed by Tyki. Yet unknown to Allen, the Innocence lingered around as a hazy fog of particles; at the time, a direct reflection of his shattered state of mind. It wasn't until he came to an epiphany that he was able to seize control of his Anti-Akuma weapon once again and achieving his Innocence's true, fully-invoked form. When not activated, his arm is black and meets with his shoulder in a spiraling pattern that ends with tattoo-like emblem. Following this, the Order gave it the official designation of Crowned Clown (\u795e\u30ce\u9053\u5316\uff08\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\uff09, Kuraun Kuraun), due to its jester-like appearance when invoked. The kanji used in the name literally translates to God's Clown (\u795e\u30ce\u9053\u5316, Kami no Douke).\n\r\nWhen invoked, Crowned Clown acts as a body-armored Innocence, forming a white-hooded cowl and sleeve of Innocence energy which covers his shoulders and right arm, while his left arm and hand become slender and black, clad in armor and razor sharp claws. A masquerade-style mask is always affixed to the cowl, which takes on various configurations and appearances. This transformation also changes Allen's usual hairstyle from flat to a spiky rear. As before, his Innocence possesses a certain degree of sentience, but as Crowned Crown is able to manipulate Allen's entire body like a marionette when incapacitated, or simply assisting in evasive tactics.\n\r\nWhen facing Tyki yet again, Allen synchronization with his Innocence exceeded 100% which activated his new Crowned Crown ability, Sword of Exorcism. The Sword of Exorcism has the ability to exorcist an Akuma on touch and even the ability to exorcist the Noah Gene from Noah's themselves. What shocked Tyki the most wasn't the ability of the sword but rather the similarity between Allen's Sword of Exorcism and the Millennium Earl's sword.\n\r\nStory\n\r\nInspector Levrier and Cross have both referred to a \"player\" (as in one who plays a musical instrument), and Cross has hinted that there may be more than one.\n\nAllen Walker has the 14th a.k.a Nea inside of him. Cross and Nea made a deal with each other and it was Cross who agree to have Allen hold Nea's consciousness. After being struck by Kanda's Innocence, the Nea inside Allen begin to awaken and slowly take over Allen's body.",

    "name": "Yuu Kanda",
    "description": "Age: 17, currently 18\r\nHeight: 177cm (5'9\"); was 175 cm (5'8\") (start)\r\nWeight: 59 kg (130 lbs); was 61kg (134 lbs) (start)\r\nHair Color: Dark Blue, Black \r\nEye Color: Dark Blue\r\nBlood Type: AB\r\nInterest: Gardening, making Soba \r\nLikes: Soba, Tempura (pumpkin, green peppers, and lotus root) \r\nDislikes: Anything group related and lots more\r\nNationality: Japanese\r\nRelatives: Unknown \n\r\nKanda Yuu is a main protagonist character and member of the fictional religious organization known as the Black Order, in the anime and manga series D.Gray-man, by Katsura Hoshino.\n\r\nKanda is a young and handsome Japanese man usually found in any mood that isn't positive. Kanda has long black hair (dark blue in the anime), which the mangaka notes that he uses soap to wash. Lavi comments that Kanda is a \"pretty-type character\", and Allen occasionally calls him \"feminine face\". He also has been commented that he has \"dark eyes\" by the head of the Asian branch (9 years ago) and he has blue eyes in the manga. Kanda seems to be conceited over his hair.\n\r\nPersonality\n\r\nKanda comes across as cold, stoic, and arrogant, even to his fellow exorcists. In battle he will do anything to win, sometimes at the risk of his teammates. He once made a sarcastic joke about leaving them to die. It is his opinion that exorcists are not saviors.\n\r\nYuu, or Yuu, is Kanda's given name, though he dislikes being called by it or even introducing himself as such. He calls Allen \"bean sprout\" (\u30e2\u30e4\u30b7, moyashi, English Dub: \"Short Stack\"). Kanda seems to know Lavi, though he doesn't hesitate with his usual threats if Lavi calls Kanda by his given name; however, it is clear that Kanda does care for his fellow Exorcists and the Finders (whom he claims not to care about).\n\r\nHe tends to mask his emotions and often claims, \"It's none of my business.\" In spite of his intentions, he and Allen are often at each other's throats and rarely see eye-to-eye on anything.\n\nKanda's personality seems not to have changed since he was young. At age 9, he was moody and easily annoyed, especially towards another \"second exorcist,\" Alma Karma, who often followed him around; however, his final conflict with Alma seems to have hardened him further, for, though he was seen laughing with Alma as a child, no such display of frivolity has been witnessed since then.\r\nKanda's favorite foods are soba noodles and tempura (especially pumpkin, shishitou [a small, sweet green pepper], and lotus root). Kanda dislikes many things, to the point that \"there are too many to write down\"; however, Kanda himself points out that he hates people with naive personalities, people who don't keep their promises, cursed people, people who can't keep their mouths shut, people who call him by his given name, and \"sweet things\".\n\n\r\nHistory\n\nKanda was originally an Innocence accomodator and exorcist of the Black Order, but he was killed by an Akuma. There was also a woman in his life whom he loved.\n\r\nKanda is \"reborn\" a second generation exorcist created by the order 9 years previous to the current events of the story through the efforts of the Epstain and Chang families. His body was modified to heal incredibly quickly in order to sustain synchronization tests. He regularly underwent a shockingly cruel and painful procedure to force them to be able to synchronize with his Innocence, literally tearing him apart in the process. Due to his second exorcist strength and ability to regenerate, the procedure was repeated even after he had \"died\" several times. Although initially extremely hostile towards Alma Karma, another child of the second exorcist program, the two eventually become close friends due to their shared experience at the hands of the Order.\n\r\nYu begins seeing an illusion of a woman who Alma initially assumes is Fou, the guardian deity of the Asia branch since she had appeared to Alma whilst he was distressed following syncro-testing. He also starts to dream of her and of his death at the hands of an Akuma. The Order realize this and decide that they should terminate Yuu from the program. Alma hears this conversation and rescues Yuu although he is captured by CROW guards in the process.\n\r\nAfter landing in a sewer he is washed up in front of a younger Bak Chan and Noise Marie. Eventually after a brief exchange Kanda was taken by the members of CROW to be \"terminated\" for learning the truth about the Second Exorcist program. The \"procedure\" proves a failure as Kanda's past memories of an unknown woman reanimate him and allow him to summon the Innocence of Mugen in a sword form which he uses to free himself. As he is escaping he finds an injured Marie and while examining his wound, his blood starts to heal Marie. Kanda decides to take Marie with him in his search of Alma but upon finding him discovers that Alma has killed the staff of the Asian Branch and the members of CROW with his own newly-acquired Innocence. A battle ensues between a psychotic Alma and Kanda resulting in Yuu's arm being cut off. As Alma explains his reasons for murdering everyone he attacks Marie and impales Kanda, leading him to find the resolve to deal a menacing blow to Alma.\n\r\nAbilities\n\r\nKanda can recover much faster than ordinary humans and able to withstand the blood of Akuma due to a secret skill created by the Chang family, he is also seen being able to rebirth after death \"approximately during 580 seconds\", reproduce falling limbs, and have an abnormal physical strength.\r\nInnocence\n\r\n\"Mugen\" (\u516d\u5e7b,Six Illusions). Kanda has a sword with supernatural powers. He runs his index and middle finger through the back of the blade to activate it, whilst saying Mugen Unsheathe, Innocence Activate, which turns the blade silver. The Shape of the sword has changed throughout Kanda's Timeline, during his childhood, it takes the form of a small butcher blade with multiple small wings on the hilt, upon Kanda's introduction in the beginning of the series, it took the form of a chokuto (a straight Japanese sword without a tsuba) with a black cross-emblazoned hilt and sheath, but after his battle with Skin Boric, it was reforged into a traditional Katana.\n\nKaich\u016b: Ichigen (\u754c\u87f2\u300c\u4e00\u5e7b\u300d English dub: Underworld Creatures, First Illusion, lit. Hell's Insects: First Illusion): Kanda swings his sword and releases a small swarm of supernatural creatures that devour his opponents.\r\nNigentou (\u4e8c\u5e7b\u5200, lit. Double Illusion Blades): Kanda covers his sword and scabbard in a coat of energy and generates an energy blade, creating two impossibly sharp weapons. The second blade that he creates over his scabbard can also be just a pure energy blade if the scabbard is not used. \n\r\nHakka Tourou (\u516b\u82b1\u87f7\u8782, lit. Eight Flowers Praying Mantis): Using Nigentou, Kanda quickly slashes the enemy eight times. The slashes collectively resemble a flower.\n\r\nShouka (\u6607\u83ef, lit. Sublimate): Kanda activates the power of his tattoo, and his pupil changes into three dots. Veins also rise around his eyes. Once Shouka is activated, Kanda can activate Sangenshiki. \n\r\nSangenshiki (\u7981\u5fcc \u300c\u4e09\u5e7b\u5f0f\u300d, lit. Three Illusions): Kanda drastically increases his speed and strength at the cost of some of his life. \n\r\nConsume, Mugen: Kanda reconstructs a broken Mugen by reconnecting the pieces with energy. Mugen appears to fall apart after one slash, however. \n\r\nBakuhakuzan (\u7206\u9b44\u65ac, lit. Explosive Spirit Slash): Kanda needs Sangenshiki to be active to use this, and makes a slash that seems to create small explosions and is strong enough to cut through a Level 4 Akuma. Kanda can also use it with the Fifth Illusion Style.\n\r\nFourth Illusion Style: Kanda's Pupil changes to four dots and he gains another drastic increase in speed and power.\n\r\nFifth Illusion Style: Kanda's hair changes to a shade of light purple and stands up straight, while Mugen's blade glows with a different color and emanates large amounts of electricity. It uses a large amount of Kanda's life. The effects of this sword also seems to give Kanda a need for destruction while sealing up the rest of his emotions leaving only his anger. When he uses the maximum power of the fifth illusion style, the sword takes the same form as when he was child (small butcher blade with multiple small wings on the hilt).\n\r\nRipping Flash Claw: Kanda unleashes seven sharp energy beams.\r\n(Source: D.Gray-Man Wikia)",

Her parents were killed by an Akuma when she was very young. Because she is an Accommodator, the Black Order took her away from her only remaining family member (Komui) to Headquarters against her will. For three years she was never allowed to leave the place, which felt like a prison to her. Because she attempted suicide, she had to be restrained and tied to her bed. However, once Komui joined the Black Order, Lenalee became more at ease in the Black Order. She once told Allen that her \"world\" consists of her friends and family; if something terrible ever happened to them, she would be devastated.\n\r\nShe is an Exorcist whose anti-Akuma weapon is a pair of boots, \"Dark Boots.\" That, when invoked increases one's speed and strength greatly in the legs.\n\r\nAside from being able to have great speed, she can also fly with her boots. Techiniques shown so far:\r\n- Onkyou no tougi: Otokase\r\n- Suijou no tougi: Mizukase\r\n- Enbu Kirikaze\r\n- Shittsui no tougi: Tetsukase\n\r\nAfter the battle against the Level 3 Akuma, Lenalee lost the ability to use her Dark Boots for period of time. However, it has come to mind that after the battle, her innocence may be the heart of the innocence.\n\nManga spoilers:\nIn chapter 153 she made a promise with her innocence so it would become stronger to protect everything she loves, and so it liquified and fused with her blood, creating a better version of her Dark Boots. After defeating the Level 4 Akuma, the boots transformed into a red ring that stays on her legs until the innocence is activated.\n\r\nShe is the first known exorcist to create this new type of innocence named \"Crystal Type.\"\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

His parents were killed by Akuma when they were young, and when it was found out that Lenalee was compatible with an Innocence she was taken away from him. It was shown that Lenalee was kept in the Black Order, away from her only living family (Komui), against her will. When she tried to commit suicide, she had to be strapped down to the bed. However, Komui joined the Order and became the Science Department Supervisor for her sake and Lenalee begin to feel more at home in the Order.\n\r\nKomui is shown as a very whimsical and goofy character, he is somewhat sadistic and borderline maniacal sometimes (\"Why did Komui end up so strange...? I patterned this character after Yoshida. My editor.\" - Quote from Vol 1, Komui's profile page). He drinks coffee nonstop (or more specifically Lenalee's coffee unless he has no choice), is lazy and often tries to worm his way out of doing work by either running away from the office (Reever has to track him down), talking on the phone non-stop even when the other side hung up or other methods (he created a robot named Komurin II that went berserk and nearly tore the Headquarter apart). He keeps a notoriously messy desk and lost Allen's letter of recommendation from General Cross when Allen first joined the Order, which led the Order into believing that Allen was an intruder. In the manga when it was asked how much do his colleagues trust Komui, the mangaka answered that it was 99% trust and 1% murderous intent. During his naps, one of the only ways to wake him up is to say that Lenalee is getting married due to his doting personality.\n\r\nKomui, despite everything, does have a serious side. He feels guilty for throwing the Exorcists and Finders into danger, and tries to help in anyway he can, such as making better uniforms to protect the Exorcists. He is also the one to repair damages done to the Innocences of the Exorcists although the method seems very painful. He showed a more solemn and ruthless side in the funeral for the Exorcists and Finders by refusing requests to bring General Yeager's body back to his home and saying that the General's body must be cremated. Firm in his beliefs, Komui has shown a daring in refusing to follow Special Auditor Malcom Rouvelier's orders about keeping the Akuma Egg, and instead issues his own orders for the Egg's destruction.\n\r\nLenalee and Komui seem to share some kind of telepathic link, shown when Komui collapsed when Lenalee was being drowned by Eshi and that Lenalee can tell when Komui is taking a nap even from the other side of the world. He seems to be close friends with the cook Jerry and often hides out in the kitchen.",

He later trains under Ku Fei in Martial Arts to make up for his weakness in close combat, advancing very quickly (even learning how to do instant movement, otherwise known as shundou), and applies a strong magical barrier around himself to avoid damaging his frail body. He eventually becomes a master of using delayed spells as a battle tactic. Due to the training he had with Evangeline and Jack Rakan, his magic and combat capability increases exponentially. Negi also learns and improves upon Evangeline's \"Magia Erebea,\" which absorb offensive spells into his own body. He also came up with a new spell: \"Spell Synthesis: Lightning God Lance Titan Slayer\" which is a new high class lightning spell. Negi even manage to use Magia Erebea's ultimate ability by using a magic circle that can stop and absorb the enemy's attack whether it is magical or spiritual attack and use it against them, which even Evangeline herself could not master it. In the latest chapter, it is shown that Magia Erebea marks have begin to spread all over Negi's body and that Negi has formed a temporarily pactio with Shiori, one of Fate's subordinates.\n\r\nHis aim is to become a Magister Magi (master mage) like his father and find his father who is currently missing.",

    "name": "Kenshin Himura",
    "description": "Birthday: June 20, 1849\r\nHeight: 158 cm\r\nWeight: 48 kg\n\r\nKenshin Himura, also known throughout the anime as Hitokiri Battousai (Battousai the Manslayer) or Himura the Battousai is the main character of the anime series Rurouni Kenshin.  His original name was Shinta (\u5fc3\u592a).  His parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon.  Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and were about to kill him when a man named Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning \"Heart of Sword,\" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.\n\nHowever, before full completion of the sword style could be passed on to Kenshin, the Japanese Revolution had been happening at the time and right before Kenshin's eyes.  Because of his kind nature and seeing people suffering, he knew he needed to do something about it.  He left in the middle of his training and without his master's blessing and joined the Imperialists.  It was during the Revolution where Kenshin met Tomoe, his first love and wife.  (See Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal OVAs).  During the revolution, Kenshin was given the nickname of Hitokiri Battousai because of his god-like speed of drawing a sword to kill the enemy instantly.  \n\r\nAfter helping the Imperialist to a position where they would undoubtedly win the revolution, Kenshin left the revolution all-together with a vow to never kill again and the reverse-blade sword handed to him by Shakku-dono. It was Tomoe's death by his hands that pushed him over the edge of never to kill again.\n\r\nThe next time Kenshin is seen is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes.  Those long 10 years have taken him from Kyoto, all over Japan to where we find him in episode one of the anime, in Tokyo, still keeping his vow never to kill again.  It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again. (See Rurouni Kenshin anime).  \n\r\nKenshin is usually depicted as a care-free swordsman who is very aloof and tends to be a bit simple-minded when it comes to living normally.  He is seen to be doing many of the chores around the dojo that he stays at with Kaoru, (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.).  He believes it is his way of repaying Kaoru with allowing him to stay at her dojo. (although it seems he has gotten attracted to kaoru in the end).\n\r\nHowever, his swordsmanship ranks among the elite as he is seen defeating every rival (with the exception of Hajime Saitou which ended in a draw).  His battle senses are top-notch and he recognizes even the slightest of advantages, strategies and tactics during a sword battle.  \n\r\n(Source: Kenshin Wikia)",

    "name": "Sanosuke Sagara",
    "description": "Sagara Sanosuke left home at an early age to join the Sekih\u014d Army (Sekih\u014d-tai), leaving behind his father (Kamishimoemon), his mother (Naname), and his younger sister (Uki) who adored him. He would return home years later to discover that his mother was dead, having died a couple of years after the birth of his younger brother, Ota, who immediately began to admire Sanosuke for his bravery and boldness. Sanosuke would also find out that his family name was now Higashidani, although he would never use it himself. His sister, after Sanosuke's disappearance and then her mother's death, became overprotective of her younger brother and father, who worked as a local merchant and farmer with the infamy of being a local fighter. Ota, after Sanosuke leaves his family again, would eventually follow his brother's advice and train at the Kamiya Kasshin-Ry\u016b style dojo to become strong.\n\r\nThe Sekihoutai fought for the imperial alliance at the end of the Tokugawa regime and Sanosuke admired his captain, Sagara S\u014dz\u014d and took the family name Sagara from him. The Sekih\u014d Army were on assignment to spread word of the halving of taxes proclaimed by the revolution. However, when the revolutionary government encountered financial problems, they labeled the Sekihoutai as frauds to bury their promises. This setup was engineered by Shind\u014d Tatewaki, a former officer in the imperial alliance. The Sekihoutai were designated scapegoats and to be executed; Sanosuke was the only survivor, other than his friend Tsukioka Katsuhiro. The exact circumstances of S\u014dz\u014d's death differ between the animated version and the manga; in the manga Sanosuke realized he had been killed after seeing his decapitated head on display as a warning, while in the anime a wounded S\u014dz\u014d pushed Sanosuke to safety off a cliff in order to save him before dying himself.\n\r\nFull of anger and bitterness, Sanosuke made a living as a fighter-for-hire who bore the nickname \"Zanza\" derived from his weapon, the zanbat\u014d. Sanosuke's sword, the heaviest katana ever made in the Rurouni Kenshin universe, originates from the \u014cnin Struggle. Due to wear the blade no longer has an edge. Sanosuke uses the sword to smash and crush.\n\r\nHiruma Kihei and Gohei hire Sanosuke to kill Himura Kenshin, but after the former assassin defeats Sanosuke and Sanosuke learns of the truth of Kenshin's no-kill approach, Sanosuke becomes a valuable ally. He later adopts a boxing-like fighting skill, known for the strength of his right fist. Because the zanbat\u014d broke during the fight, Sanosuke no longer wields it on a regular basis, using only one more time in the manga to defend the Kamiya dojo during the Jinchu arc.\n\r\nAt the end of the manga series, Sanosuke leaves Japan to avoid becoming wrongfully arrested and travels the world. He is not heard from until five years later during a reunion of the Kenshin-gumi, in which he tells them via a letter that he is in Mongolia and will stay there for a while before heading back to Japan.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He likes to irritate Hijikata and the rest of the Shinsengumi by acting like a girl. He loves children and has a sweet tooth, and he adores Kyoto candies. One of the youngest members of the Shinsengumi, he mastered all the sword techniques of the Tennen-rishin-ryuu (the style of kenjutsu used by the Shinsengumi) in his teens and went on to become a teacher in his twenties.

The reason he gives for allowing them to call him by such a nostalgic name is that if he uses the name 'Okita Souji,' no one will play with him...Yes, he is in his early twenties, but he still plays with children all the same. He is short for a guy and seems to like walking along with his hair flowing freely behind him when he is off-duty.\n\r\nHijikata, Okita's mentor, made Okita choose whether or not he would take up the katana at the age of nine. In episode 7, Okita accuses Hijikata of having made a mistake with him, by allowing him to hold a katana at an age where he was not yet ready to choose.\n\r\nAlthough he is an excellent swordsman, he has two weak points. He can't adjust his strength to accommodate the people around him, and as a result, no one wants to practice with him (since they always end up with injuries). Even with an armour and shinai (bamboo sword), Okita can cause serious injuries. He also has a disease called Tuberculosis which surfaces from time to time.",

In the series, he seems to be the one in control of the entire Shinsengumi, though the decisions of the Shinsengumi are made by a council of three: Kondou, Hijikata, and Yamanami. The mentor of Okita Souji, the tensai swordsman, he was no pushover in swordfighting. In episode one, you'll get a taste of just how good Hijikata is.\n\r\nIn the later episodes, Hijikata is seen to worry about Okita's illness as well as about Tetsunosuke. He refuses to let Tetsu hold a sword, apparently for fear that Tetsu will walk down the same bloody path as Okita. He has a deep sense of commitment to the Shinsengumi, and this is the most probable reason why he puts on a stern, unforgiving face. In Episode 7, he reprimanded Kondou for allowing the Shinsengumi to play like a 'gang of buddies' and told him to stop doing things to soften the Shinsengumi's edge. He tolerates no imperfection but is not unreasonable. As such, he has the respect of all 40 members of the Shinsengumi.",

Though his skills with the katana leave much to be desired, he is practically invincible with a spear and is a master of the Taneda Houzouin-ryuu spear technique. He is a fun-loving guy that loves to eat (especially at the expense of others) and enjoys poking fun at the chibi. He, Toudou Heisuke and Nagakura Shinpachi make up the Comedian Three.\n\r\nDespite his crude, rough exterior, Sanosuke has a kind heart. He hates seeing people being bullied and will go out of his way to aid those in need (although he is also the one who stomped all over Tetsu in the first episode). Another of the first members of the Shinsengumi, he was around before the Shinsengumi moved to the capital. A little erratic, he is not someone Hijikata trusts to send on errands.\n\r\nHe will do almost anything for food, especially food cooked by Ayumu. For example, in episode 6, Sanosuke was actually trailing behind in the marathon. But when he thought about the super-size meal cooked by Ayumu (the prize) his speed increased drastically to the point whereby he caught up with Yamanami and Shinpachi, who were in the lead.",

He has a twin brother named Hao who is a powerful reincarnation of the original HAO who keeps getting reborn. For this reason, You is said to be the only one who can defeat his brother, and he himself is, as stated in the manga, a half of the original HAO, thus has many of the qualities of the reincarnation before him. You also has a fiance, named Anna, who he saved from her destructive power of Reishi (mind-reading put simply) which is helped by Hao's old cat friend, Matamune. Matamune, however, dies drastically after saving Anna's life, giving the last bit of his energy to do this. When You was 13, he joined the Shaman Fight, with the reason to make his life a more comfortable place, for both him and Anna.\n\r\nYou himself is a pretty laid-back type of guy. He gets along with everyone around him, and making friends comes easy to him. Although he may not seem serious most of the time, he actually can get really serious when needed to be. Ironically, his twin brother, Hao is a bit like this as well, and many of You's characteristics overlap with his as well. You however, seems to be a bit more sensible than Hao since he looks at things always in a positive light and has something good to say about everything.",

He is a member of the SRT (Special Response Team) of the Western Pacific Battle Group \"Tuatha de Danaan\". His call sign is Urzu-7 and his ID number is B-3128, and operates as team point-man as an Arm Slave specialist. \n\r\nIn addition to being a capable Arm Slave pilot, Sousuke is a specialist in Arm Slave operations and maintenance, improvised explosives, small arms, survival training, anti-armor combat, trap setting and camouflage. Additionally, he is proficient in logistics, demolitions, breach and forced entry, covert intrusion, and hand to hand combat. His background and experience as a guerrilla fighter, and later a mercenary soldier has made him much more sensitive and knowledgeable about tactics and methods more commonly used by guerrillas than government trained regulars. \n\r\nSousuke is unfortunately not very good at social interaction off the battlefield. He constantly causes many problems for Kaname Chidori due to his military nature. Even in school he carries a gun with him although it is loaded with non-lethal shells. He is also very bad at blending in with normal members of society due to his nature (i.e. following Kaname with stalker-like aspects and jumping off a train to follow her). That is, he has no readily available \"civil\" concepts about life, like entertainment or anything recreational and tends to horribly misinterpret the actions of people around him(like considering a guy who dumped his girlfriend a high-level tactician who is to be reckoned with). This is shown throughout the main series in multiple episodes, and the Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu! series focuses mainly on this aspect. This part of his personality is indeed one of the main sources of the series' humor. \n\r\nHis previous name during his guerrilla days was Kashim which was given to him by Majido, a strategist of the guerrilla forces in Helmajistan. \n\r\nIt is assumed that he changed his name to Sagara Sousuke when he left Helmajistan. While in Helmajistan he had a close friend named Zayid. \n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Her specialty is channeling, and she can summon a spirit from anywhere, even from heaven where normal shamans can't reach. In the English anime, she is called a \"spirit medium.\"\n\r\nAfter being abandoned by her birth parents due to her abilities, Anna was adopted by Kino Asakura. Because of this, her date of birth and blood type are unknown.\n\r\nAggressive and decisive as she is beautiful and shrewd, Anna is a pragmatic person who appears cold and harsh. However, she has shown that she genuinely cares for those important to her, especially Yoh, and merely is dedicated to be \"the ultimate Shaman Queen\" and wife to Yoh, the first true friend that she ever had in her life. She firmly believes that Yoh Asakura is destined to become the Shaman King, and thinks that it's her duty as his fianc\u00e9e to make him train hard for it.\n\r\nAnna's spiritual strength is shown as she was able to seal in Hao Asakura's guardian spirits (called as shikigami), Zenki and Kouki, and was able to control them. Anna and Hao seem to have an odd relationship of their own\u2014Anna detests Hao and even slapped him once. Surprisingly, he was not angry, but actually seemed amused. It has also been hinted that Anna is the reincarnation of the original Asakura Hao's mother from 1000 years ago, Asano-Ha; others think that Hao possibly had feelings of his own for Anna and wanted her for himself, it had not been proven false because what he said to her in the manga, he said he was serious about taking her as his bride.\n\r\nIt is obvious that Anna loves Yoh, despite how badly she seems to treat him\u2014she said it when Yoh fought the oh-oni to save her, once to his friend Manta Oyamada, and again to Silva, a commissioner for the Shaman Fight. She broke down crying when she thought that Yoh was about to be killed while being possessed by Tokagero. Anna can be extremely possessive of Yoh, beating him up once when she thought that the Oracle Bell he brought home was a woman's pager. She also reacted jealously when Yoh asked Tamao Tamamura to cook him a meal in the anime. Once, when Yoh was thought to be dead after Hao stole his soul, Anna was in hysterics, and only recovered her strength when Yoh returned. Anna attends Shinra Private Academy along with Yoh and Manta. Her favourite singer in the manga, Ringo Awaya, is a reference to Japanese singer and guitarist Shiina Ringo. Anna is also the mascot of the Aomori prefectural police Takei, Anna's creator, was born in Aomori. In Shaman King, Anna is also born in Aomori.\n\nAnna is married to Yoh and the two of them have a son six years old named Hana Asakura.",

    "name": "Ren Tao",
    "description": "He is serious, logical, and emotionally aloof. He has become like this because of how he was raised. Because of his father, Ren had adapted a deep hatred towards humanity and a strong yearning to eliminate them all. He also believed that his spirit companion, Bason, was only meant to be used as a tool and to treat him as a friend would only result in the spirit taking advantage over him. Ren's anger and hatred came from his father (or uncle in the English anime), Tao Y\u00faan (Tao En). Forced to train and study at a very young age, Ren had his childhood stolen from him. He hated Tao En for all of his suffering.\n\r\nAs he gains the friendship of Yoh and the others, he realizes that everything he once believed about the world was not true. He learned to trust others and that humans weren't as awful as he thought they were because Yoh and the others showed him that some people truly are kind. A new will to change himself took over. He wanted to let go of his hatred so he could be able to move on with his life, so he returned to China to defeat his father.\n\r\nHis first attempt failed, but he refused to give in to his father, even as he remained chained in the dungeon of his home. Thanks to Bason, Yoh and the others came to help him. He thanked them for rescuing him but was persistent in saying that he didn't want any help from them. He said it was his problem alone. But eventually all of them defeated Tao Y\u00faan together; allowing Ren to finally move on.\n\r\nRen tries hard to maintain a tough and confident exterior and is aloof, but deep down would risk his life for his allies. Ren is a particularly impatient person with a very short temper, and isn't afraid to hurt the source of the anger.\n\r\nRen is an egotistical person and usually doesn't care that people think that he's overly proud. He even named his own team, \"Team the Ren,\" much to the annoyance of his teammate, Horohoro. His overflowing self-confidence annoys some of the other characters. In addition, Ren is also very intuitive, quick-witted, and sometimes stubborn. He is also very defiant. He rarely listens to what anyone says or takes their instructions. Before and during the process in which he befriended Yoh, he even was bold enough to disobey his father on various occasions.\n\r\nIt is mentioned that Ren is skilled in more than one area of combat. Not only is he a powerful shaman capable of doing things most shamans his age would not be able to, but in addition, he also seems to be skilled in martial arts and sword fighting, in addition to also learning many of Mikihisa Asakura's techniques simply by experiencing them firsthand. It is also lightly suggested in the manga that Ren can also play the erhu.\n\r\nAs the series progresses, Ren begins to trust others more. Out of all his friends, his bonds with Yoh and Horohoro seem to be the strongest. Ren often fights with Horohoro and the two do not seem to get along at all. However, after Ren sacrifices himself to save him, it becomes apparent that they really do care for one another. As Faust worked to try to save Ren's life after the incident, Horohoro did his best to protect the unconscious Ren.\n\r\nRen's name in Chinese means \"benevolent,\" \"tough,\" and \"edge of a knife,\" all of which are reflected in his character. His actual Chinese name, Li\u00e1n, means \"lotus\". In the English dub, he is given a British accent. He also has an obsession with milk and the number 3.\n\r\nHis Furyoku is 100,001 (as seen in chapter 276)\n\r\nIn Shaman King Character Book, there was an interview asking what kind of girl he likes and he said he would only like a girl if she's smaller than him and not annoying. This must be the reason why he married Iron Maiden Jeanne and had a son named Men Tao.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

They lead happy lives without even trying. Ridiculous, isn't it?\"\n\r\nAsakura Hao is the main antagonist in Shaman King. He was born Asaha Douji in Japan during the Heian era. During his third life he becomes the twin brother of his descendant Asakura Yoh. His name translates to Leaf King. He is the most powerful shaman in the entirety of the series. His childhood is told in the manga side story Mappa Douji.\n\r\nDuring his first life, Asakura Hao was constantly surrounded by the horrors of war and thus saw the world as a grim and dark place, until he met the small demon Ohachiyo, who taught him all the positive aspects of life. However, after an accident involving Hao's first Over Soul, Ohachiyo became a permanent part of Hao and cursed him with the very dangerous ability of Reishi. As he grew into an adult Hao became a relatively peaceful man who sought to help the people around him, and thanks to him the Asakura Family prospered. It was because of this gentle and kind nature that he took in the cat Matamune, who wound up becoming what he considered his \"only friend.\"\n\r\nHowever, his Reishi abilities became too strong and eventually went beyond his control. The negative emotions and thoughts of others were constantly overwhelming him and, since he was unable to turn his Reishi off, the deluge of negativity eventually created a demon inside his own heart. The internal confusion and disorder that was also created eventually led to his desire of creating a Shaman only Kingdom on earth and drove him to become the Shaman King in order to reach this goal.\n\r\nIn his third and most current incarnation, Hao is usually calm, cruel, and all smiles. The occasions when he is really angry are very rare and when he is angry with someone, that person is usually killed and burned to their soul by The Spirit Of Fire. He also likes to watch Shaman Fights, particularly those that involve strong Shaman, and Asakura Yoh. He is not only interested in that, but also claims that when Yoh reached his limit, he will eat him to become the strongest Shaman.\n\r\nHe has shown some dislike of being given family titles, as he glared at Yoh in the last chapter when the latter called him \"Nii-chan,\" and his face darkened when his nephew, Asakura Hana, called him Uncle Hao. Both times he told the person not to call him that.",

In addition, Horohoro can also get very competitive, even going so far as to turn Ryu's arms to ice and shatter them during the fight between The Ren and Funbari Onsen.

Ayumu considers the name \"slow\" and \"spacey\", but she lacks the energy or motivation to dispute it. The nickname sticks so well that she is called Osaka by teachers and even in the class roster, to the point that no one remembers her real name. In the manga, Osaka mentions that she lived in Kobe when she was in elementary school and was born in Wakayama. Tomo, who says she doesn't know where Wakayama is, tells Ayumu to \"just be Osaka\". \n\nDespite the fact that her non sequiturs and tendency to nod off during lectures upset Yukari, she remains in Yukari's homeroom class all three years. Because of her poor performance on exams, she is a member of the \"Bonkuras\" (translated as \"Knuckleheads\" in the anime and \"Numbnuts\" in the manga). Her decision, on Chiyo's advice, to seek a teaching career after graduation is viewed by Yukari as a deep personal insult. \r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

By using a special trick, Yukito is able to move his puppet without strings. He uses this to make money as he travels, with most of it going toward food.\n\nOne day, Yukito arrives in a small town by the sea. Quickly deciding not to stay very long, he heads for the beach in an attempt to make some money. While by the beach, he meets a strange girl named Misuzu who quickly invites him to her house for dinner and, although skeptical, he accepts. Soon after meeting her mother Haruko and becoming friends with them, he is convinced into staying there. Yukito soon begins doing odd jobs for the local clinic after the doctor catches him doing his puppet show outside. It is here that Yukito becomes friends with Kano and Minagi; however, after getting to know them better he learns of their problems, which convinces Yukito to stay and help.\n\nAfter helping Kano and Minagi, Yukito finds out about Misuzu's illness, which is where she is unable to make friends because she'll begin crying uncontrollably. Yukito then leaves, deciding that if he leaves, Misuzu will get better; however, as he is about to leave, Yukito realizes his mistake and goes back to help. Here is when he realizes his and Misuzu's connection to the past and that Misuzu is the re-incarnation of the Winged Maiden. When Yukito finds Misuzu, she tells him of her last dream before falling asleep. Yukito then disappears in a bright light, causing Misuzu to wake up, seemingly better.\n\nIt is implied that when Sora appears in the anime after Yukito's disappearance, Sora is Yukito or contains a part of Yukito's soul.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With an obsession with dinosaurs (which goes back to her childhood), she finds it difficult to make friends and is constantly left alone. Because of Misuzu's fondness of dinosaurs, she uses the word \"Gao\" frequently, which is the noise she thought dinosaurs made when she was young. Even though Misuzu's foster mother scolds her whenever she utters it, Misuzu constantly disregards the warning and continues using it in her everyday speech.\n\nOne day, Misuzu resolves to make a friend, and after meeting Yukito, invites him over to dinner. Although Haruko disapproves of him at first, they all eventually become friends and Yukito is invited to stay. While playing cards one night, Misuzu suddenly cries without reason. Haruko soon explains that Misuzu has a condition where she cries uncontrollably when she comes close to making friends. Haruko brought her to a clinic and to a big hospital hoping it would help, but it didn't work. It was a mental instability, but the doctors said she would slowly recover as she got older. Misuzu's condition begins to worsen, prompting Yukito to leave. He soon discovers that Misuzu is related to a childhood tale he heard, and that she is the descendant of the Winged-Maiden in the tale, who has been cursed to eternal pain.\n\r\nMisuzu soon becomes ill; she becomes childlike and has to use a wheelchair. As a result, Haruko tries to adopt Misuzu officially. Unfortunately, before she is able to do so, Misuzu's biological father comes to take her with him; however, when he tries to leave with her, Misuzu refuses, calling Haruko \"Mama.\"\n\r\nEven though Misuzu stays with Haruko, her condition doesn't improve, and when Yukito returns, she is in constant pain. In the final episode, Misuzu asks that they all go to the beach together and when they get there, Misuzu attempts to walk to Haruko and Yukito, calling them \"her goal.\" Sadly, when Misuzu does reach them, she collapses and dies in Haruko's arms, ending the curse placed on the Winged Maiden.\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

Due to her inability to defeat Recca, she accepts the Fuujin when Kage Houshi (Kagerou) offers it to her after showing her its powers.

He is often referred to as by his last name, though his companions have made up nicknames for him, such as \"Mi-chan\" or \"Mi-bo\". \n\r\nDespite the difference in his age in the anime and manga, Tokiya wanted to take Yanagi from Recca because she looks exactly like his sister, Mifuyu Mikagami, who was murdered in front of his eyes when he was young. He uses the Hyomon Ken style which was developed specifically for the Ensui and the Hyoma En (a madogu that also controls water, but focuses more on water in its solid form). Tokiya joins forces with Recca in attempting to rescue Yanagi from Mori Koran's mansion, and he continues to be part of their team throughout the rest of the series.\n\r\nTokiya in both the anime and manga is initially portrayed as callous and aloof; often insulting his teammates' abilities and intelligence. He is protective of Yanagi, who closely resembles late sister, and he is shown to be interested in her romantically in the manga. Other characters have often praise Tokiya for his intellect and composure during battle, with some going as far as to say that he might be the strongest Hokage member when it comes to normal battles. Another characteristic of his that makes him stand out among his teammates is the fact that he is more ruthless and cruel than the rest, a fact recognized by both Kurei and Mikoto, who both act as antagonists throughout most of the manga.\n\r\nCertain characteristics in Tokiya's personality and appearance are different in the anime series as opposed to the manga and games. His hair is light blue in the manga and games, and brown in the anime series. In the booklet accompanying the Flame of Recca Original Soundtrack Vol. 2 CD, his age is listed as 17, while the filler page in the manga states that he is 16 years of age. Apart from these differences, Tokiya's character development in the anime is not as obvious as it is in the manga, wherein he becomes more open to emotions other than his desire for vengeance towards the end of the series. Tokiya attributes this change to his encounter with Kai, a fellow Hyomon Ken practitioner, and his friends.",

Although he does not practice any specific martial arts style, few people are able to match him in hand-to-hand combat. He has the ability to communicate with animals, and possesses a wide variety of strange and exotic pets which he named after European monarchs. He has a little brother, Shuuji, who likes Yakumo.\n\nHarima struggles often to confess to Tenma, though he knows she has absolutely no feelings for him and may even dislike him. Every time Harima finds the courage to tell Tenma his true feelings, something happens which prevents him from succeeding. Harima also must deal with situations involving his classmate Eri, unaware of the fact that she does not know whether to like or dislike him. He gets extremely jealous seeing Karasuma and Tenma together, but his attempts to put a stop to that usually end up bringing them closer. Ironically, Harima admires Nij\u014d j\u014d(\u4e8c\u6761\u4e08) the mangaka, which is Karasuma's pen name. To date, Tenma has yet to hear his confession properly. He also works as a mangaka, having Yakumo as his assistant, creating another source of misunderstandings, as it took a long time for Tenma to realize that their relationship is only professional, at least by Harima's side.\n\nIn the manga School Rumble Z last chapter, Harima is seen walking in the hospital room (where the Karasuma is) together with Eri, who is holding a baby and with a blushing face.",

She also has an after-school job as a janitor to pay her tuition fees to avoid being a burden on her grandfather. She is depicted as polite, optimistic, extremely kind, and selfless; several other characters, including Kyou, Rin and Hanajima, tell her she needs to look out for her own interests and not shoulder everyone else's burdens.\n\r\nTooru habitually speaks formally (see Honorific speech in Japanese), but not always correctly, a habit she picked up from her father, Katsuya, after he died when she was three, as a way of replacing him in her mother's eyes. Tooru's mother, Kyoko, raised her alone until she died in a car accident shortly after Tooru entered high school, a few months before the start of the story. Tooru repeatedly calls Kyoko the most important person in her life and treasures her photograph; when she falls in love with Kyou she feels guilty of being \"unfaithful\" to her mother's memory.\n\r\nIn the first half of the series, as Tooru learns about the zodiac curse and its effects on those she loves, she becomes distressed, and when she learns that the dangerous Akito is the \"god\" of the zodiac, she resolves to break the curse. Only later does she admit that she wants to free Kyou most of all. Despite setbacks, she stubbornly persists in her goal and eventually frees Kyou and her friends.\n\nIn the last chapter, she begins moving with Kyou to another city so he can continue his martial arts training, and in the final pages they are shown as a loving elderly couple with a granddaughter.\nNote: \"Tooru Honda\" is the correct spelling of this name per Hepburn romanization, which is used as a MyAnimeList standard.

He is generally a laid-back, jovial fellow, although he can be dead serious when the situation warrants it. Despite his carefree attitude, his speech is always polite, though it is sometimes sarcastic. Yoruichi Shihouin notes that he tends to go over the top with whatever he becomes passionate about. He once described himself as a \"mere honest, handsome, perverted businessman.\" During the Bount arc of the anime, when Ganju Shiba calls Urahara an \"old man,\" Urahara replies that he is the same age as Ganju's sister, K\u016bkaku Shiba. \n\nUrahara can usually be found near the scene of an important event, but will rarely step in to intervene, preferring to be in control from outside. After the event is over (i.e. the battle between Ichigo Kurosaki and Renji Abarai), he kindly pops up and helps the side he deems fit. Thus far, it has tended to be the side of the protagonists. He often tends to know more than he reveals and tends to have some form of relationship with most of the story's characters. While he is a major driving force throughout much of the story, he is usually only the catalyst, allowing others to do the work for him. Despite his appearance, Urahara is a highly skilled fighter, using a combination of powerful attacks and cunning deceptions, and is capable of holding his own against Espada-level arrancar with nothing more than his shikai. He also likes building large underground training spaces in secret. He built the first one under the S\u014dkyoku hill in Soul Society with Yoruichi for their training, and created a second one under his shop in the mortal realm for a similar purpose.He is also the former captain of squad 12 until he designed the Orb of Distortion.This is able to create Vizards(Soul Reapers with hollow powers).\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He does read the newspaper, though\nDislikes: Rain. Just about anything he finds annoying. And cats\n\r\nSanzou is a handsome creature that is anything but the traditional Buddhist monk. He is ill-tempered, swears, eats meat, drinks, and is usually seen with a cigarette hanging from his lips. Sanzou is the bearer of the Maten scripture, which allows him to banish demons. Sanzou also possesses a Smith & Wesson shoureijuu [banishing gun] which he is often seen wielding in battle. At the start of the story, he was bidden by the Three Aspects to journey to India with his three companions to stop the resurrection of the demon King Gyuumaou.\n\nBackstory\n\r\nBefore Sanzou was bestowed his present title, he was known as Kouryuu, the river orphan. He was found by his mentor Koumyou Sanzou when he was just a baby, abandoned to float downstream. Koumyou raised and taught him, and was held by Kouryuu in high regard.\r\nShortly after Kouryuu was named as Koumyou's successor, Koumyou was killed while protecting Kouryuu from demons that were raiding their temple looking for the holy scriptures. They succeeded in stealing the Seiten Scripture that Koumyou bore, but left behind the Maten Scripture. The young Genjou Sanzou subsequently went on a search to recover his master's stolen scripture, but was unsuccessful. Several years later, he came under the employ of the Three Aspects in order for them to help him in his task.\n\r\nAlthough he remembers his master fondly, Sanzou is often haunted by the memory of Koumyou's death. He despises the rain due to the fact that it poured down on the night of his master's death, and often broods whenever it falls from the sky, usually refusing to go out into it. Despite the fact that Sanzou's abilities are undeniable, he often feels as though he is unworthy of the title that his master bestowed upon him, but yet strives to become strong enough to one day see himself as deserving of it.\n\r\nIn his previous life, Sanzou was the god Konzen Douji, the nephew of the Merciful Goddess Kanzeon, who is often seen watching over him and his group from her place in heaven. He was an ill-tempered bureaucrat who had no joy or excitement in his immortal life until it was turned upside down by being named the caretaker of the young Son Gokuu. He subsequently became very attached to his charge, albeit reluctantly.\r\n(Source: Saiyuki Fansite f a t e d, Saiyuki Wikia)",

He is actually neither demon nor human, but is a heretic that was given birth by the Earth itself. He is very fast as well as strong, and uses his nyoibou [an extendable staff] to fight demons in battle. He accompanied Sanzou on his journey, and is often seen trading insults with Gojyo or fighting with him over food. The diadem that Gokuu wears on his head is actually a limiter to suppress his true form, the Seiten Taisei, or the Sage Equal to Heaven. When in this form, Gokuu is incredibly powerful and nearly unstoppable. He usually can't distinguish between friend or foe in this form, and often turns his attack toward his companions. Sanzou is capable of conjuring Gokuu's limiter in the event that it breaks.\n\nHe is also known as the monkey king.\n\r\nAlthough Gokuu has a youthful appearance, he is actually over 500 years old. Previously, he was taken from where he dwelled on Earth into Heaven due to his potential danger. Shortly after his arrival, he was placed under the care of the god Konzen Douji, who he was drawn to because of his great beauty and golden hair that reminded Gokuu of the sun in the world below. Gokuu soon befriended the war prince Nataku as well as Konzen's friend Tenpou and his companion General Kenren.\n\r\nUnfortunately, Gokuu became embroiled in the politics of Heaven. Due to the stress of certain events, Gokuu's limiter broke, causing him to revert to his true form. He killed a number of gods who tried to attack him, and his three friends Konzen, Tenpou, and Kenren, took him and fled. After the deaths of Gokuu's companions [the circumstances of which have yet to be revealed], his memories were sealed and he was imprisoned on Earth at the base of a mountain for his crimes against Heaven. Centuries later, Genjou Sanzou was drawn to the place that Gokuu was imprisoned by the sound of his 'voice.' The monk reached out to Gokuu, and the chains that bound him and the bars that confined him vanished. Since then, Gokuu has always been at Sanzou's side, not realizing that he has been reunited with the caretaker that he adored so long ago, as well as the two friends that he lost.\r\n(Source: Saiyuuki Fansite, Saiyuuki Wikia)",

    "description": "Birthday: September 21\r\nSign: Virgo\r\nBlood type: AB\r\nHeight: 181 cm (5'11)\r\nWeight: 69 kg (153 lbs.)\r\nHair: Brown\r\nEyes: Green\r\nHobbies: Drinking\n\r\nDespite his pleasant and calm outward expression, Hakkai is a demon not to be reckoned with. He is capable of channeling his chi into powerful bursts of energy in battle, and can also form it into a shield to protect himself or his friends. He wears three ear cuffs that are his limiters. When removed, his true power is released. He can often dispatch demons much larger than himself or numerous foes in this form. Hakkai is often reluctant to do so due to the possible danger to his friends. Hakkai is the member of the four journeying with Sanzou that tends to mother the others [for lack of a better term], cleaning up after them, shopping, etc. The jeep that the group of four is driven in by Hakkai is actually his small magical dragon companion, Hakuryu.\n\nLong before the journey to the west, Hakkai was known as the human Cho Gonou, an orphan who later met and married his older sister Cho Kanan. He was a teacher in the village that they later lived in together. One day, Gonou returned from work to find that the townspeople had given his wife as an offering to the centipede demon Hyakuganmaou because they saw her as the most expendible of the women, being without relatives. Enraged, Gonou slaughtered a large number of townsfolk before journeying to the demon's castle. There he killed every demon he found single-handedly. Coming upon the imprisoned Kanan, he wanted to free her and take her home with him. She informed him that she couldn't leave with him, since she had been raped and impregnated by the demon king. Using Gonou's blade, she killed herself in front of her husband.\n\r\nThe distraught Cho Gonou was come upon by the remaining son of Hyakuganmaou, Chin Yisou, who attacked him, slicing his belly. Wanting to find out whether or not a tale that he'd heard was true, Chin Yisou dripped his own blood into Gonou's wound. Having now bathed in the blood of 1,000 demons, Gonou became one, killing Yisou before leaving the castle.\n\r\nThe wounded Cho Gonou was saved physically by the half-demon Sha Gojou, and spiritually by Genjo Sanzou, taking the new name Cho Hakkai as a symbol of his rebirth. He and Gojou became very good friends due to their experiences together before the journey to the west. Many times, Hakkai still reflects on his past pain, and his memories of Kanan are bittersweet.\n\r\nIn his previous life, Hakkai was a god in Heaven. He was known as Field Marshall Tenpou, an eccentric military man who was fond of his library of books, many of which were about the world below. He could often be found with his nose in a book [or buried under them] in his library. He was the friend of Konzen Douji as well as his subordinate General Kenren. He and Kenren were fairly inseparable and had an easy-going relationship despite their difference in rank. Their soon to be enemy Li Touten [father of Nataku], referred to Kenren as Tenpou's 'husband' at one point. Although Tenpou tended to be mild-mannered, when provoked he was not to be taken lightly and would fiercely defend those that he cared about, qualities that he carried over into his next life. The god's weapon of choice was the katana.\r\n(Source: Saiyuki Fansite, Saiyuki Wikia)",

He is often teased by Goku and Sanzou due to his lecherous behavior. However, he is a loyal and reliable friend who has a soft spot for women in danger who are in need of help. He is a half-demon, which granted him his red hair and exotic red eyes. His weapon in battle is a jakujou [a staff with a crescent-moon shaped blade attached to the end by a chain that can be elongated].\n\nWhen he was a boy, Gojou lived in a rather unhappy home. His demon father had had an affair with a human. His father later dumped his illegitimate child on his demon wife before abandoning her. His stepmother is the only mother that Gojou ever knew. She often took out her frustrations on Gojou, physically and mentally abusing him while weeping for herself and her situation. Gojou's demon older brother Jien would often try to protect Gojou from his mother's rage. No matter how hard Gojou tried, he was unable to win his mother's affection, and was tormented as much by the sight of her tears as he was by the fact that she professed love solely for his older brother.\n\r\nOne day, Gojou's mother had reached her limits, and attempted to kill Gojou, first scarring the side of his face with her claws, then attempting to strangle him. Gojou was saved by his older brother Jien, who tearfully killed his mother before fleeing, leaving Gojou alone. Gojou later made his way in the world by first being involved in shady activity with his friend Banri before mastering gambling at cards. He survived the loneliness of the nights by bedding loose women. He used to despise his red hair, since it represented the things that his mother had hated about him.\n\r\nOne night on his way back from a bar, Gojou came upon the bleeding form of Cho Gonou. He soon took the unconscious man back to his home and nursed him back to health. He was the first one that Gonou confessed his crimes to, bonding with the troubled newly-born demon over their different yet shared pain. Gojou tried to protect Gonou from Sanzou when the monk came to bring Gonou back with him for judgment. After Gonou left with Sanzou, who later informed him that Gonou had 'died,' Gojou cut off his long locks as a sign of mourning. He was later reunited with Gonou, now Cho Hakkai. The two of them became good friends and roommates before embarking on the journey with Sanzou several years later.\n\r\nWhen Gojou previously lived in the world, he was known as General Kenren, a boisterous and flirtatious raven-haired god who lacked respect for all of his superior officers other than his friend Tenpou. He was fond of women, but was even fonder of sake, which he was often found sipping while lounging in one of the sakura trees in Heaven. Kenren was usually the one to ruffle the feathers of his superior officers, with Tenpou examining the results.\r\n(Source: Saiyuki Fansite f a t e d, Saiyuki Wikia)",

She would much rather prefer fashion and relationships than to physical activities. In terms of physical features her hair is much longer and she has a \"softer voice,\" apart from that the two can't be distinguished (shown in episode 5 of the anime when the two switch places so Risa can get out of chopping cabbage as a form of after school punishment).\n\r\nRisa obsessively pursues Dark, coming up with intricate schemes and plans to make him go out with her, some of which eventually work. There's no doubt that she is quite clever and very persistent. Later on, however, Dark tells her that the two of them cannot see each other anymore. Near the end of the anime, subtle signs of a relationship between Risa and Satoshi start to show. (example: he places her on a park bench and covers her body with his jacket after she fell unconscious during their struggles with Krad. She then wakes up only to find the jacket and a single white feather which fell from it. Although not knowing who the jacket and feather belongs to, she can be seen treasuring it). In the manga this is more apparent, shown through small occurrences (example: he saves her when she fell off a building, when Daisuke saves her from drowning he shows concern and touches a lock of her hair).\n\r\nAs the series progresses, Risa breaks out of being a naive little girl and develops into a more mature young lady.",

Satoshi opposes Krad taking control of his body greatly, and has taken on an uncaring personality to \"seal his heart,\" and thus, Krad.

This marks the beginning of Watanuki's very involved part-time job, a fated meeting with a certain quartet from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, and so many \"chance\" happenings which occur not out of coincidence, but \"hitsuzen\".\n\r\nWatanuki is known for a having both a volatile and caring nature to him. Depending upon the person he talks to, his emotions tend to be overly exaggerated. With Himawari he throws himself into the air accompanied by hearts and a \"Himawari-chaaaaan!!\" squeal. With Domeki, he almost always expresses irritation with various facial expressions, screaming, and arm motions that reminds Himawari of an angry cat. With the exception of these two and Y\u016bko, Watanuki tends to address everyone around him with formality and kindness.\n\r\nOne of Watanuki's greater problems, especially early on in the manga, is his lack of self-worth. He found absolutely no value in himself and would often use himself to aid another, even if his life were at stake. \n\nAn example of this is when he willingly gives up his right eye to the Spider's Grudge to save Domeki's, without considering how much his decision might hurt Domeki. He's forced to face up to this problem when trying to save the Zashiki-Warashi from the Joro-Gumo, when the spider matron harshly chastises him for his lack of consideration for both his own self and those who cared about him. Faced with the facts of how much he's hurt those around him, Watanuki begins to see some value in himself. He will still often use himself to save others, but now he is mindful of just how much his actions hurt other people.\r\nLife for Watanuki changes significantly once he starts working as Yuuko's assistant (rather, her very indignant indentured servant) who not only cooks (wonderfully), cleans (diligently), and complains (constantly), but finds himself performing very odd jobs and learning more about the occult. \n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, xxxHolic Wikia)",

Some lords reawaken their failed ambitions to control the country, some pursue revenge on old enemies and recover lost loves, and some nobles just try to protect their homelands and peoples as guardian gods of the lands. Now, the Yami-Sengoku (Dark Civil Wars) are unfolding.\n\r\nKagetora has been reborn several times during the last 400 years as the powerful Reincarnate (Kanshosha), with psychic abilities and continuous memories, and with a special power to purify and exorcise unredeemed spirits.\n\r\nHowever, his current reincarnation, Takaya, does not have his original memories, and represses his identity as Kagetora, for reasons which are initially unrevealed. Nevertheless, he's thrown into brutal psychic fights with reincarnated fighters and spirits of the land. Initially, he involves himself reluctantly because his beloved friend Yuzuru Narita is targeted. Soon, Takaya assumes the role of commander and fighter with boundless, sometimes destructive powers. Despite his outside aloofness and darkness, he cares for his men, his close friends and his younger sister, trying to carry on the lonely and thankless duty laid on him by Lord Uesugi Kenshin 400 years ago.\n\r\nUesugi Kagetora was a relatively obscure historical figure. He died young in an internal power struggle in the Uesugi family 400 years ago. He was a son adopted by Lord Uesugi Kenshin, initially as a hostage from the neighboring Houjou Clan, but was deeply respected and loved by Lord Kenshin.",

In a few volumes, however, we discover his true nature, his boundless passion and obsession with Takaya (Kagetora), and his strong attraction to and burning envy of Takaya's superiority. The intense painful love- hate relationship between the two protagonists is a driving force of the whole series.\n\r\nNaoe loves Takaya and devotes himself entirely to him but he resents Takaya's superior strength, power, and independence in the relationship. Naoe cares for Takaya, calms him when needed, and would die for him, but also nurses a devouring desire for and resentment towards him. It is suggested that Naoe did something brutal and unforgivable 30 years ago to Kagetora's then (female) lover Minako, and the tragedy caused Takaya's loss of memory in this lifetime.",

Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he's named just Piccolo).\n\r\nDragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu's victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu & Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins & Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) & consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek).\n\r\nIn Dragon Ball GT, which is not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by Pilaf via the Black-Star Dragon Balls. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. After collecting the spheres, Gokuu does battle with Baby (a Tuffle who wants revenge on all Saiyans for killing his race), Super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy Artificial Human 17) and various Evil Dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the Dragon Balls; they are called Shadow Dragons in FUNimation's dub). The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.\n\r\nIn Dragon Ball Online (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, in which Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike Dragon Ball GT), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.\n\r\nIn Cross Epoch, the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.\n\r\nIn Dragon Ball Minus, it is revealed that Gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (Gine & Bardock) to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Gokuu leaves Planet Vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away.\n\r\nGokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. He will eat anything without much qualms. He has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (Gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). Gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned Krillin's marriage to Android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). Despite his kind-hearted nature, Gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. He has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. Because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. His most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence.\n\r\nHe's so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. Such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by Beerus at Bulma's birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy Gero's lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents' strength even though it might've meant the destruction of mankind. This is also touched upon when he spares Vegeta for a rematch in the Saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. However, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against Cell so that Earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, Goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent).\n\r\nGoku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of Dragon Ball Kai. In Dragon Ball Super Ep. 4, Goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. He has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with Gohan in the Androids arc, Goten & Trunks in the Buu arc, and Uub at the end of the series).\n\r\n(Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Character Guide)",

She has always been in love with him (in Japan, such relationships between first cousins are legal and generally accepted) and must learn how to deal with these feelings, especially with the threat that he may fall for one of the other girls. She adores strawberry sundaes, but the mere mention of her mother's \"special\" homemade jam makes her sick.\n\r\nNayuki is a heavy sleeper, which has led her to collect dozens of alarm clocks; they do not work on her, but instead wake Yuichi every morning. Since she has such trouble waking up, she is always running for school and is in fact the school's star runner because of this. Similarly, she became the captain of the school's female track team despite being in her second year. She takes a long time to get up in the morning and will pass out several times during the morning before completely waking up. Despite her attempts to stay conscious, she still tends to fall asleep a lot in class.\n\r\nNayuki has a fondness for animals and never misses an opportunity to try to pet one, even wild animals, such as cats, dogs, or even the occasional fox if she can help it. Unfortunately for her, she is allergic to cats. One of her defining features is that she tends to talk slower than the rest of the characters. She will often state the obvious to Yuichi, such as when lunch break occurs or when school ends.\n\r\nNayuki is second to Ayu as the most used character in the series' marketing. Also, in both anime adaptations, her story runs at the same time as Ayu's.",

    "name": "Yuki Nagato",
    "description": "Height: 154 cm (5' 0.5\")\r\nOccupation: Student (grade 11) Data Integration Thought Entity Humanoid Interface\n\r\nYuki Nagato is a quiet high school freshman that is the only member of the SOS Brigade that was not \"voluntarily arrested,\" or coerced into joining, by Haruhi Suzumiya. When Haruhi claimed the empty Literature Club as the SOS Brigade's clubroom, Yuki was found reading there. Haruhi claimed the clubroom and Yuki as part of the Brigade, both of which she didn't mind. She lives alone in the same apartment complex as Ryoko Asakura. She wears glasses and her school uniform at all times, only discarding the former after Kyon babbled that she was cuter without them and that he wasn't a 'glasses man', and the latter when the SOS Brigade went on vacation.\n\nYuki is a \"humanoid interface,\" or artificial human, created by the Integrated Data Entity for the purposes of interacting with and observing events on Earth. Specifically, she is assigned to observe Haruhi, who is the cause of an explosion of data that occurred when she used her godlike powers to recreate the world three years prior.\n\r\nAs an artificial human, she has numerous paranormal abilities. She is capable of manipulating the properties of the environment and any materials within it at any scale to her desire, referred to as \"bogus magic\" by Kyon. For instance, she can create a baseball bat that only hits home runs, nullify data links (removing other artificial interface connections from their bodies), plus she is able to make a cover up story (since Ryoko was gone, she made a cover up story that she moved to Canada), and reconstruct a classroom, down to the last detail, after everything in it was completely destroyed. As a result, she is capable of feats of superhuman strength, agility, and stamina. In one instance, she was unfazed while impaled by multiple metal spikes, and effortlessly reconstructed her body afterwards. Her state also affords her an extreme level of intelligence. She can comprehend the rules and concepts of a game instantaneously, as well as create flawless strategies based on her observations, and was able to learn how to play a guitar mere moments after receiving one.\n\r\nYuki has a very stoic and introverted personality, preferring simple body language rather than speaking. When prompted to speak, she does so in a very concise manner, always speaking in a monotone and displaying a dispassionate complexion. She thinks very rationally, and finds it difficult to communicate with normal humans due to her intelligence and lack of empathy. She enjoys reading, and is seen reading a book in the majority of her appearances. As the series continues, she develops a sense of humor, although her unchanging facial expressions make it near-impossible to discern whether she is joking or not. Despite her reserved manner, she is reliable and trustworthy, resulting in Kyon trusting her more than other members of the SOS Brigade.\n\r\nYuki is described by Haruhi as the SOS Brigade's \"indispensable silent character.\" She was neither recruited by nor did she join the Brigade but was actually included along with the room when Haruhi arrived and declared it as her own. Whenever she is in the club room, she is usually reading. Similar to Itsuki Koizumi, Yuki is obedient when orders are given; however, her loyalties lie more with Kyon rather than Haruhi. The other members often rely on Yuki and her abilities whenever needed most, notably when the SOS Brigade was losing in the baseball tournament, the contest against the Computer Society, and in the case of the Cave Cricket. Aside from this role, she is also responsible for Kyon's safety, as evident when she saved him from an attack by Ry\u014dko, since Kyon's presence stabilizes Haruhi's emotions.\n\r\nIn the SOS Brigade's amateur movie production The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina, Yuki was cast as the leading antagonist. She was portrayed as an alien, who could also use magic.\n\r\nKyon also realized after the \"cave cricket\" incident that Yuki plays a \"behind the scenes\" role, making her one of the puppeteers whose goals are to ensure Haruhi is fully satisfied and that order and balance are maintained. Her intentions of being in the Brigade are to monitor Haruhi and prevent her from feeling bored or greatly disappointed because it is generally believed by the Integrated Data Entity that a drastic event that could end the universe would occur. It is also believed that Haruhi is also the key to evolution and thus it is important for Yuki and other humanoid interfaces to continue their observations. She also has the ability to detect any spatial changes in the environment caused by Haruhi and will act to prevent them from persisting. An example of this is during the unscripted attack in the first fight scene of the Brigade movie, when she tackled Mikuru in order to remove her contact lens which had temporarily caused the fictional \"Mikuru Beam\" to become real.",

    "name": "Haruhi Suzumiya",
    "description": "Birthday: October 8\r\nHeight: 158 cm (5'2\")\r\nBlood type: AB\r\nOccupation: Student (grade 10-11), Ultra Director, Ultra Detective, Brigade Chief and Founder\n\r\nBackground\r\nHaruhi Suzumiya, a first year student at North High School (in novels 1-8), and second year (in the 9th and latest novel), can be characterized as funny, eccentric, and somewhat unpredictable. In the series, she is introduced declaring her interests in aliens, espers and time travelers and does not care for \"ordinary\" human beings. The last thing on her mind is a normal high school life. With a burning desire to find such phenomena in the world, she is generally unapproachable and finds ordinary people boring and uninteresting. As a result of this, many of her classmates choose to avoid and confront her. She deals with her emotions by creating a parallel universe, where she inadvertently releases transparent creatures who tear up and destroy everything that comes into contact with them. Espers are the ones who can stop these creatures by cutting and destroying them, because if these creatures are left alone destroying everything as well as the outer barrier it could affect the outside world. She also likes to dress up Mikuru in random outfits.\n\r\nKyon is the first character to engage with her in a serious conversation. From this encounter, she gradually begins to soften up to others and starts to open up with her classmates. Later on, Haruhi took Kyon against his will and forced him to help her start the SOS Brigade, thus she has taken an unknown interests to Kyon later in the series. It is hinted that one of the reasons as to why Haruhi opened up to Kyon was that he resembled John Smith; John Smith and Kyon are the same person.\n\r\nShe is noted as smart, athletic, and naturally talented in any extra-curricular activities. She once joined every activity club in her school and quit because she found them boring, despite pleas by the club members for her membership. Her musical talent was highlighted when she stood in as the emergency lead singer and guitarist, along with Yuki, for the band ENOZ during the school festival.\n\nHer childhood is cited as an originator for her interests in strange phenomena. While attending a baseball game with her family, she was shocked to see the vast number of people who had come to see the game. Before then, she had often thought of herself and her life as being special and interesting, yet then came to realize that they were just ordinary normal occurrences and habits and that she is just one of many living human in all of Japan in which Japan is just part of Earth. Consequently, she believed then that there must be at least one person in the world who is living an interesting and truly unique life and sought out to effectively be that person thus motivating her to seek out the extraordinary.\n\r\nAfter this realization she became notorious in middle school for doing odd things which included painting strange hieroglyphs all over the school grounds using a field marker and placing all the school desks in the halls. Additionally, she accepted and rejected every guy who had ever asked her out, the longest lasting a week and the shortest being five minutes. She only seeks relationships with aliens, espers, and time travelers. This shows the depth of her interest in finding non-humans and strange phenomena.\nIn actuality, Haruhi is believed to be either a crack in the space-time continuum, the first technological singularity to be spontaneously born in the universe, or some sort of deity, depending on point of view. This belief stems from a massive spontaneous universal event that occurred three years prior to Haruhi meeting Kyon, of which Haruhi is said to be the cause. The event attracted the attention of three prominent groups: the Extraterrestrial Integrated Data Entity, time travelers from a distant future, and a group of espers known as the \"Agency.\"\n\r\nHer powers which are capable of altering, creating, or destroying reality are triggered by her emotions and inner desires. It's been theorized by the espers that the current universe may be just one in a string that Haruhi had subconsciously created. In order to relieve stress whenever she becomes too emotionally unstable, patches of alternate dimension referred to as \"closed space\" are created and within resides gigantic blue entities that destroy the surrounding area. Despite having these powers Haruhi is completely oblivious to them or the existence of aliens, time travelers, and espers.\r\nPersonality\r\nAt first, Haruhi seems very indifferent and cold but underneath that front she is very spontaneous, upbeat, and hyperactive. Her determination, persistence, and resourcefulness drive her endeavors of finding strange phenomenon and promoting the SOS Brigade. Because of her dedication, she becomes hot-headed when things don't go her way. Hand-in-hand with her cleverness and creativity, and a certain ruthlessness, even seeming amorality, she can often get what she wants, an example of such is when she blackmailed the Computer Society President into giving her a brand new computer for the SOS Brigade. Haruhi tends to pursue her goals regardless of who gets in the way, or is hurt, such as Mikuru in the aforementioned blackmail. She also has a tendency to be jealous and angry when Kyon gets too friendly with any girl. Evidently, the universe was almost destroyed and recreated when Haruhi's jealousy was pushed too far.\n\r\nHaruhi also has a very competitive personality and accepts without hesitation any challenge that crosses her, regardless of difficulty or time constraint. Her constant optimism and over-confidence make her seem arrogant. She has very high standards and won't accept anything less than perfection from herself and her Brigade. She places a lot of trust in her Brigade members, especially Kyon, to get the task done whatever it may be. This can sometimes make her seem selfish and unkind.\n\r\nShe is not shy and often attracts a lot of attention to the point of not minding changing clothes in front of various people, more so when her SOS Brigade is in mind. When it comes to Mikuru she is very physically playful. She often comments on Mikuru's attractiveness and seems to find a kind of enjoyment in exploiting it to her own ends, often through forcing Mikuru into and out of various costumes such as a bunny girl costume as if she were a human dress-up doll.\n\nHaruhi also seems to hate showing signs of vulnerability to others. Following her concert performance at the school's culture festival when she and Yuki filled in for two members of the band ENOZ, Haruhi showed awkwardness toward the band members when they thanked her the following day. As Kyon pointed out, Haruhi was not used to receiving praise from others because of how mischievous she regularly acts toward others because of her abnormal interests.\n\r\nThough many of Haruhi's efforts are devoted to finding supernatural beings, she does not actually believe in them. This is suggested by Itsuki during the first light novel, that Haruhi does not force himself, Yuki, or Mikuru to reveal themselves because her commonsense will not let her believe that they exist. In fact, between the first and second light novels, when Kyon tries to convince Haruhi that the other SOS Brigade members are more than they appear, she does not believe him. Later, she bases The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina on Kyon's story.\n\r\nSOS Brigade role\r\nHaruhi is the founder and \"Brigade Chief\" of the SOS Brigade, or Saving The World by Overloading it with Fun Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade. She was unable to find any existing club suitable to her preferences. She made the group in order to find and have fun with aliens, espers, and time travelers. Upon creation, she names herself as its leader. Her method of finding and recruiting members is to \"voluntarily arrest\" them then force them to join.\n\r\nThe SOS Brigade is very precious to her and has stated to Kyon that she has no intention of yielding her position as Chief to anyone else. She will go to any lengths, even by exploiting the members, to bring attention and support for her Brigade such as procuring room and materials, maintaining their website, participating in sports tournaments, organizing activities such as city-wide searches for strange phenomenon among other things. She wrote, produced, and directed the Brigade's amateur-movie The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina for the school festival.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to her is the true purpose of the SOS Brigade: to prevent Haruhi from becoming bored, as her boredom would bring about the end of the world as the SOS Brigade's members know it. Kyon also happens to be a very important person in her life. For whatever reason, Haruhi \"chose\" Kyon. This is first said by Yuki, then restated by Mikuru, and Itsuki as well. She often relies on and trusts Kyon with anything. Kyon is the only person whom she has been open with, and when she briefly created a \"new world,\" he was the only person she had brought over from the \"old world.\" These are all made evident in the fourth novel The Vanishment of Haruhi Suzumiya, where she remained at Kyon's side for the three days he was in a coma due to a small accident; however, he is apparently worth far more to her than even she realizes. Unknown to her, the person she knew as John Smith, who \"helped\" her draw weird symbols at the schoolyard of East Junior High (her old school) at night on Tanabata three years prior, is in fact, Kyon from the present time, sent back in time. Furthermore, his time there unintentionally created an alternate timeline where no SOS Brigade existed, Yuki, Mikuru, Ryoko, Itsuki, and Haruhi were normal humans and the latter two never transferred to North High, thus no SOS Brigade. Only by going back to that night again was Kyon able to set things right. Finally, should Kyon reveal to Haruhi that he is John Smith, it would radically change everything, as he stated to the Integrated Data Entity through Yuki.",

    "description": "Height: 152 cm (5 ft)\r\nOccupation: Student (grade 11-12), SOS Deputy Vice Commander\n\r\nMikuru Asahina, a shy and timid girl with a childish na\u00efvet\u00e9, is the only character other than Kyon to be brought into the SOS Brigade against her will. She is defined by Kyon to be extremely cute, and is often sexually harassed by Haruhi Suzumiya.\n\nShe is in fact a time traveller from the future with the purpose of observing Haruhi during the course of the story line.\r\nConsidered one of the most beautiful girls in high school Mikuru is as kind, caring and thoughtful as she is beautiful. She easily gets scared or flustered, and is apparently prone to daydreaming as she can also be rather clumsy at times. Nevertheless, she can be surprisingly resilient and is capable of recovering from even the most discomforting of situations. However, because of her gentle nature she seems rather helpless most of the time. Kyon sees it as his duty to always watch over and protect her, although, when it comes to Haruhi there is no rescue.\n\r\nMikuru is the designated \"mascot\" of the SOS Brigade, serving as a way to attract interest and members by using her attractive physical qualities\u2014her cute face, trim figure, and noticeably sizable bust. She was \"voluntarily arrested\" by Haruhi, who deemed it necessary to have an alluring lolita type in the club. Her sex appeal and innocence is often exploited by Haruhi to procure resources. Mikuru is on a regular occasion forced to wear any outfits that Haruhi buys for her. Haruhi also sees it fit that Mikuru is unable to dress and undress by herself most times and often does it for her, much to Mikuru's considerable\u2014and vocal\u2014distress. So far, Mikuru has worn the following outfits: maid, waitress, nurse, frog costume, cheerleader, miko, and the infamous bunny-girl.\n\r\nThe name \"Mikuru (\u307f\u304f\u308b)\" is derived from \"Miku\" which when written in Kanji is \"Mirai (\u672a\u6765)\" (\"future\" in Japanese).",

    "name": "Itsuki Koizumi",
    "description": "Height: 178 cm (5' 10\")\r\nOccupation: Student (grade 11), Vice Commander\n\r\nItsuki is the last member to have joined the SOS Brigade, having been recruited by Haruhi as a \"mysterious transfer student.\"\n\nItsuki was sent to observe and keep Haruhi emotionally stable, in order to protect the rest of humanity. Although he is an esper, which is exactly one of the sorts of people Haruhi desires to meet, Itsuki never reveals himself as such, at least, not to her.\r\nItsuki is constantly smiling and always speaks in a formal and polite manner. He is also prone to giving long and detailed explanations, usually illustrated by exaggerated hand gestures. Itsuki has confirmed to Kyon once that his outer personality is merely an artificial image he fakes in accordance to Haruhi's impression of him, and hints that his true character is something quite different, being \"less pleasing\" in the eyes of others. Maintaining his casual, constantly smiling self, however, is vital for keeping Haruhi's mentality balanced.\n\r\nOut of the three Brigade members, Kyon is the least fond of Itsuki. He often finds himself annoyed with Itsuki's plastic smile, his willingness to acquiesce to Haruhi's outrageous schemes, playful teasing and his various forays into his psychological and philosophical theories (e.g., omphalos hypothesis, Anthropic principle, etc.). He is also distrustful of Itsuki's intentions, comparing him to Yuki Nagato when it comes to deciphering his expressions. Itsuki's fondness for speculation often causes him to produce explanations for situations involving the SOS Brigade, its members and related events. Ironically, Itsuki can only share his theories with Kyon and also enthusiastically plays different kinds of board games with him to pass the time, despite losing all the time, although Kyon suspects that he may be doing so on purpose.\n\nDespite the theory he advances in which Haruhi is the equivalent of God, Itsuki says that there are many differing lines of speculation about Haruhi within \"The Agency.\" Itsuki himself does not believe in a singular God, nor does he regard Haruhi as such, although he reveals that he has colleagues that do. Apparently, most of the questions that he raises about Haruhi's true nature are philosophical in nature and do not necessarily represent his personal beliefs. Itsuki also reveals that the majority of \"The Agency\" advocates observing Haruhi instead of doing anything that might provoke her.\nIn the Disappearance arc, the altered Koizumi reveals that he has a crush on Haruhi. This does not necessarily mean that the real Koizumi harbors such feelings, but it is possible that he would have feelings for her if Kyon would not be Haruhi's love interest.\nIn the Astonishment arc, Koizumi is revealed to be the leader and founder of the Agency. Furthermore, he reveals part of his true personality when he blows up at the aliens and time travelers for meddling. More or less, he threatens war against both factions should they continuing tampering with Haruhi. Koizumi also says that he is a part of Haruhi's subconscious made physical, although he never explains what he means more fully. He seems especially suspicious of the time travelers, particularly Asahina (Adult).",

    "description": "However, it turns out that she is Yuki's backup, and as such, is also another \"humanoid interface.\" Much like Yuki, she finds it difficult to empathize with humans, but unlike Yuki, possesses exceptional social skills. Initially she cheerfully supports Kyon's reaching out to Haruhi, often encouraging him to \"open her up to the class,\" making Haruhi easier to observe. However, she later decides to try and kill Kyon with a combat knife in the hopes of catalyzing an observable reaction from Haruhi. Her efforts are stopped, after Yuki defeated and removed her from the physical world. It's interesting to note that her cheerful personality doesn't falter, even at the moment of her own demise. Afterwards, Yuki fabricated a cover story that she moved to Canada.\n\r\nRyouko makes a reappearance in the Disappearance arc, on an alternate timeline in which Haruhi never attends North High or forms an SOS Brigade. In this timeline she is just a normal human and is very kind to the shy Nagato; however, this Ryoko's timeline is obssesed with her; when she seemingly sees Kyon trying to shoot Nagato with a gun, she stabs him with a knife, believing that this is what Yuki wanted, it was briefly shown that Ryoko may show feelings for Nagato and would do anything to protect her.\r\nIn the Astonishment arc, Ryouko takes her rightful place as Nagato's backup since Nagato became ill. While she still wishes to kill Kyon (and even goes to far as to tell him this with a smile on her face), she ironically saves him twice from Kuyou. Kyon made the decision that she should not enroll at North High again (as he doesn't want to provoke Haruhi) which she agrees to. Ryouko is currently unable to attack Kyon because Emiri was given special counter-measures against Ryouko's attacks. Because of this, Ryouko is actually a bit of an ally to Kyon at this point.",

    "description": "Her fang-like tooth gives her an idiosyncratic speech pattern, causing her to misspeak words by leaving out syllables, as seen in episode 9. Her speech pattern is often accompanied with a lisp and her catch phrases \"megas\" and \"nyoro.\" Her knowledge of the SOS Brigade comes almost exclusively from Mikuru. She is also the heir of the Tsuruya family, which purportedly collaborates with Itsuki's Agency. It is also unknown if Tsuruya has a secret identity or agenda.\n\r\nThough not an actual member of the SOS Brigade, she does play a minor role in Mikuru Asahina's Adventure - Episode 00 and serves on their baseball team in episode four. She also has a small appearance in the ninth and twelfth episodes of the anime, but otherwise appears relatively sparingly throughout the anime. She appears a few more times during the novels, appearing more prominently than in the anime's rendition of the same stories, and even getting along very well with Haruhi. Kyon believes this is because both Haruhi and Tsuruya are nearly insane. Though she is not a brigade member, Tsuruya is still used as an extra body for some of the Brigade's activities.\n\nIn the light novels, it is strongly implied that Tsuruya's wealthy and venerable family is a covert supporter of \"the Agency\" to which Itsuki Koizumi belongs. Tsuruya herself seems to possess some knowledge of the secrets of the SOS Brigade and other matters, although she never explicitly says so. Tsuruya temporarily takes care of Mikuru Asahina during an event when the latter has a double presence in the \"present\" of the SOS Brigade and is also the caretaker of a mysterious artifact discovered on her family's grounds, both at Kyon's request.\nIn the original light novel The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, Tsuruya's role in the altered reality is that of Mikuru Asahina's best friend. She is shown to be extremely protective of her, even resorting to violence to keep her safe, but still maintains her cheerful disposition.",

The character was taken from a friend of the authors, whose name was also Kaname Chidori, living in Japan. However, the discovery of her Whispered abilities attracts the attention of terrorist organizations. As a result, Sousuke has been assigned by Mithril to protect her. While Sousuke Sagara's battle intuition generally saves her from dangerous situations, she often considers Sousuke's instincts an irritant in daily high school events, leading to countless comical situations.\n\nNonetheless, she and Sousuke continue to grow closer, to the point where they have expressed their feelings for each other.\n\r\nKaname's Whispered abilities also grant her an inherent knowledge (but not necessarily understanding) of advanced mathematics and science. It is no surprise then, that she consistently achieves top scores in these subjects at school. Her abilities as a whispered, however, are a bit buggy. She does not know her full abilities, and also sometimes enters a near-trance, where she understands Black Technology completely.\n\r\nAfter a point in the series, she makes it obvious to herself that she likes Sousuke, but that doesn't stop her from hitting him with her Harisen. Kaname is very easy to anger, especially considering Sousuke's antics. A humorous comment made by Kurz Weber about her anger was when he saw her lose her temper and commented, \"What happened to my angel?\" A majority of the stunts pulled by Sousuke will cause Kaname to go into a rage fit and either hit Sousuke or chew him out. However she has a soft spot for him and when he does a good job she will often cook for him or give him a compliment. \r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She is also very smart when it comes to battlefield tactics and conflicts and she displays some very impressive military prowess and strategy at several points. She also seems to have a nervous habit of playing with her ponytail.\n\r\nSometimes however, as stated by Kurz Weber, \"whenever Tessa was told by someone she couldn't do something, she made it a point to prove them wrong\". Tessa seems to have some trouble tolerating her job at times due to the position she has. Some scenes have shown her irritated by what she does while other scenes show her slightly depressed by it. Nevertheless, she seems to have a large amount of stamina, and is able to cope with the stress of her tasks, and does a wonderful job doing so.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "Tenchi suffers a great deal of stress as he tries his hardest to be a gentlemen while most of the women within the household will take the opportunity to display their attraction for him. In the third OVA series Tenchi is discovered to be engaged to Noike (aunt of Ayeka and Sasami). The arrangement was done by Tenchi's great great grandmother, known better was the \"Devil Princess of Jurai.\" Tenchi also found out around this time that he has an 80-year old sister named Tennyo Masaki, who looks like his late mother, Kiyone. Tenchi then learned from his grandfather, Katsuhito, that since Earth is a developing civilization, the Masaki clan must keep their true presence hidden since they do not age at the same rate as Earthlings, and those who are born into the Masaki family are also kept from these secrets until they come of age which is when they reach adulthood. After a climatic battle between the three Goddesses, the truth behind everything has happened was linked to the three. They decided to change the time line in order to repair the damage that they have done, and Tenchi, in his changed time line, doesn't get to meet Noike. However, Noike, along with Fuku, traveled into the past and altered the message Mihoshi was to send to her family (the message was originally altered by Z) so that she WOULD meet Tenchi.\n\r\nTenchi is the most powerful character in the series, but is too young and immature to have full control over his Light Hawk Wings and other abilities. He is a competent swordsman and martial artist capable of superhuman feats thanks to his Juraian blood, but has only displayed his more unusual talents during dire situations, such as his duel with Kagato, the escape from a black hole, and the final confrontation with Z. The extent of Tenchi's powers is unknown; at one point they rage out of control, forcing the Goddesses to step in and prevent a catastrophe. Tenchi also has an unexplained connection to a high-level entity, superior even to the three Goddesses. Airi notes in GXP (the same continuity) that Tenchi has several powers they haven't discovered yet - some examples include his instant teleportation off of the planet when Z destroys the Earth, his speedy teleportation to Saturn when Z is about to slice him with his Light Hawk Wings, and his ability to keep up with his friend Seina in a race despite Seina having drastic body enhancements and going downhill on a bicycle.\n\r\nIn \"Ai Tenchi Muyo,\" he is a student teacher at Junai Girls Academy, where he now sport a more professional attire and wears glasses. Only, Sasami, Aeka and Ryouko lives with him.",

After Hakuoro's final battle with the darker half of Witsarunemitea, the halves join together once again, with Hakuoro's side straining to maintain dominance. He decides to seal himself away so that his other side will not cause anymore destruction, and bids farewell to each of his comrades. Eruruu confesses her love for Hakuoro and the two share a kiss. Hakuoro says that he will return back to her and Eruruu says that she will wait for him. The conclusion hints that Hakuoro returns through the final scene with Eruruu, though not really seen.\n\n\r\nOther Names: Iceman/Witsarunemitea\n\r\nIn the earliest of Hakuoro's memories, he is seen as an archeological research scholar who stumbled upon Witsarunemitea's fossil hidden in an advanced laboratory. An unknown scientist catches him and explains that he did not want anyone to know of this forgotten deity; the \"missing link\" in human evolution-- for he felt that it should not exist. To protect its concealment, he shot the archeologist and his blood landed on the fossil. Witsarunemitea then awakened and restored him in exchange for taking his body as a vessel so that he will not be disturbed again. As a symbol of the contract, he acquired the mask which represents Witsarunemitea. Much later, his frozen body is found by researchers who unfreeze him and name him 'Iceman.' Although initially under the pretense of helping him, the researchers were actually interested in researching his ability to survive outside of a greenhouse environment and interested in further increasing their longevity. Artificial beings based from his body were created for further studies, including subject #3510 whom he named \"Mikoto\" and #63 whom he named \"Mutsumi.\" Iceman fell in love with Mikoto and later on escaped with her and had a child with her; although they're both eventually recaptured. The scientists dissected Mikoto to experiment on her, which caused Iceman to go into a rage and awaken his abilities as Witsarunemitea. Realizing what he is doing, he asks Mutsumi to destroy him; but she is unsuccessful. Instead, she manages to seal him, but he is separated into two: Hakuoro possessing his good side and his human form; and a formless evil side that must possess a host body to gain physical form. However, the seal cannot hold them forever and the two halves periodically become free. In the current time, Hakuoro awakens with no memories, and the latest of the forms taken by the darker side is that of the Onkamiyamukai scholar Dii.",

    "description": "Though at one point Robin asks what Amon's ability is, he never answers and is never revealed. Originally, he is reluctant to team up with Robin, as he is told to \"keep an eye on her\" by STN-J (Japanese branch) boss Zaizen, as Robin is sent from Solomon (headquarter). However, seeing her worthiness in cases concerning highly prominent witches, he eventually accepts her. Later on in the anime, Amon disrupts Zaizen's plan to eliminate or take Robin into Factory. Soon after, Solomon attacks STN-J, and once again Amon saves her.\n\r\nAfter that episode, Amon is not seen in STN-J anymore, but found to be working directly for Solomon. He is ordered by Solomon to hunt Robin, as she has learned the arcana of the craft and her powers have grown beyond Solomon's control. However, when meeting face to face with Amon, Robin fully accepts Amon's decision whether to kill her or not. Amon finds that he cannot kill her.\n\r\nIt is revealed near the end of the series that Amon's father was a witch and his mother a \"seed\", indicating that Amon himself also carries the dormant witch trait. Amon fears the awakening of those dormant genes. Amon's mother willingly accepted his father's lead and she \"awoke\" as a witch and from then on, she no longer recognized young Amon. His fear and hatred for witches originated from that moment, though his behavior throughout the whole 26 episodes is neither particularly hateful nor fearful toward witches. At the last episode, when Robin realizes that her role was to make witches and humans live together in peace as \"Witch Eve\", Amon volunteers to be a watchman who would terminate her if she turns destructive.\n\r\nAmon and Robin's survival is not known, but Karasuma was with two of them until the last moment, and she emerges alone. Karasuma's unconcerned answer \"don't know\" suggests that Robin and Amon escaped safely. The relationship between Amon and Robin has not been any more than a professional relationship. However, Amon breaks up with Touko, Zaizen's daughter. They seemed to be already falling apart somewhat. Touko calmly accepts that and suggests that Amon \"changed,\" suggesting that Amon has become a warmer person to say such things as \"suddenly I thought of you and called.\" While Amon and Robin are never seen in romantic light, Amon repeatedly goes extra lengths to save Robin, and Robin would trust her life with Amon.",

He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills.Except a single fight where he uses knives against a fellow chef. Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef \"Red Leg\" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue.\n\r\nSanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his \"love-cook\" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname \"ero-cook,\" or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around women, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a \"strict upbringing.\" To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\r\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.\n\r\nBeing the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crewmates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more.\n\nIt is revealed that Sanji is the third son of the Vinsmokes, a family of killers. His father and one of the Yonkou, Big Mom, has arranged a marriage between him and the 35th daughter of the Charlotte family, Pudding.",

For example, he vowed to walk 500 laps around Konoha on his hands if he lost a contest with Kakashi, and proceeded to do so upon losing, even though people eventually stopped paying attention. He also doesn't hesitate to do things he doesn't enjoy or that others might find embarrassing if it means his own self-improvement, as seen with his belief that one cannot dislike food regardless of its ingredients or taste. In addition, Guy values his youth to a great degree and dislikes the idea that he may not be as young as he once was. To help remedy this problem he spends large amounts of time with his younger teammates, hoping to acquire some of their youthful properties. Likewise, he often refers to himself as \"Konoha's Prideful Green Beast\".\n\r\nGuy is the self-proclaimed rival of Kakashi Hatake. Kakashi, however, is indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Kakashi also seems to have a habit of unintentionally ignoring Guy when Guy is lecturing him, which usually results in Guy asking himselif why Kakashi \"has to act so cool\". Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and has acquired a record of 50 wins and 49 losses in doing so.",

At the beginning of the series, Sakuragi was a slacker, always trying to ask girls out but getting constantly rejected (the 50th rejection occurring at the start of the series). He then met Akagi Haruko, with whom he fell in love immediately. This passion led to him joining the Shohoku basketball team. However, as a complete beginner, he was not able to keep up with the rest of the team at first despite his physical attributes (great height, athleticism, stamina, speed and leaping ability). He regards himself as a genius though, with self-confidence that borders on arrogance. His most recognizable trait is his red hair, though he shaves his head as reparation for an error that led to the loss against Kainan.\n\nAt first, Sakuragi was known for his poor basketball skills as a beginner; in his first few official matches, he fouled out every game. However, his basketball skills advanced throughout the series. First he developed his basic skills, such as dribbling and layups. Then, trained by Akagi, he became a formidable rebounder; his rebounding became his claim to fame throughout the latter half of the series. He also is seen more than once defining the match for Shohoku in the last seconds, for instance, by dunking a ball that Akagi would have missed in the league round match with Ryonan. His jump shooting was then developed by Coach Anzai, who had him make 20,000 shots in a week. He hit a buzzer-beating jump shot to win the match against Sannoh. However, he also injured his back during the match against Sannoh, and underwent rehabilitation after Shohoku's subsequent loss to Aiwa Academy.\n\nIn spite of the setbacks he has had to face, Sakuragi displays a great deal of tenacity and determination that carry him through and help reciprocate for his other failings, both on and off the court. Although his love for Haruko and rivalry with Rukawa are the main driving forces motivating him to succeed in basketball, his injury during the Sannoh match makes him realize that he has actually come to love the game, leading him to give his all for his team and bring them victory. \n\n(Source: Hoopedia)",

The only traits they share are that they are not academically inclined and good fighters. He regards Sakuragi as an idiot and both normally fight. Actually, he knows Sakuragi can put his talents to a better use, but is ashamed to see the immaturity with which he deals with things. His hobby is sleeping, and is usually seen asleep whenever he's not on the court; he can even ride his bike while asleep often crashing with objects when doing so. Waking Rukawa from a nap is considered unforgivable, since he will almost automatically beat up the culprit. Unsurprisingly, he has also been in his fair share of off-court fights, but can hold his own. Rukawa's goal is to be the best high school player in Japan, and he considers Sendoh of Ryonan to be his greatest rival. A fact being that he is often nicknamed the \"super-rookie\", the \"ace of Shohoku\", even. \n\nRukawa is extremely good at basketball, and possesses a wide range of skills to complement his height, athleticism and drive to win. Despite being merely a first-year high school player, he is the undisputed ace of Shohoku's team. In the Kanagawa Interhigh Tournament, he was named one of the top five players, the only first year player so honored. He has managed to change the course of many games, such as when he single-handedly brought Shohoku back from a double-digit deficit against Kainan (Rukawa scored 15 straight points for Shohoku in 2 minutes and 5 seconds just before the end of the first half). However, his style was criticized as being too selfish, and he sometimes comes into conflict with his teammates for various reasons; this was one of the reasons why Coach Anzai refused to give him his blessing when Rukawa told him that he intended to go to the USA, and told him to become the best in Japan before he even thought of it. When he was outplayed by Sawakita during the match against Sannoh Technical, though, he realized what Sendoh reminded him as a challenge: To defeat Sendoh, Rukawa had to change his style and pass the ball. It was his pass that led to Hanamichi's buzzer-beating shot, winning the match. Rukawa is subsequently named a member of the All-Japan basketball team. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Miyagi is a bit short tempered sometimes and hates when people make fun of his height.

Despite having opportunities to join more prestigious high schools like Ryonan, he choose to go to Shohoku because of Coach Anzai; Anzai had given him the courage to win in the Junior High tournament by encouraging him during the last seconds of the match. However, an injury to his left knee in a training session interrupted his basketball career. An imprudent early return to the basketball court reinjured the knee more severely, leading to a basketball hiatus of over a year.\n\r\nAlthough he eventually healed, he was embittered by his exclusion from the court, and Mitsui quit basketball and became the leader of a gang. His gang got in a fight with Miyagi, and during the fight, Miyagi beat Mitsui senseless before taking a beating himself.\n\r\nAfterwards, Mitsui attempted to ruin the basketball team by instigating them into fighting with his gang, as the team would have been banned from competition for fighting. In the end, Sakuragi's own gang\u2014Yohei, Takamiya, Ookusu and Noma\u2014voluntarily took the blame for the fight, and Mitsui was filled with remorse when he saw Anzai again. He rejoined the team and vowed never to fight again.\n\r\nMitsui is best known on the team as a three-point specialist, though his skills extend to other areas; during a practice match, he once managed to shut down Sakuragi, playing center. His defensive ability completely shut down Fukuda's scoring abilities. His three-pointers helped Shohoku catch up when they were 12 points down against Shoyo, and again when the team was 20 points down against Sannoh in the National Championships. His greatest weakness, though, is his lack of stamina due to his long break from playing basketball. Thus, in the latter halves of games, he has not always been as reliable\u2014he missed a potential game-winning shot against Kainan and collapsed on-court during the game against Ryonan.\n\r\n(Source: hoopiedia)",

    "description": "Height: 197 cm\nWeight: 90 kg\nJersey Number: #4\nPosition: Center\n\nTakenori Akagi is the captain of the Shohoku basketball team and Haruko's older brother. Despite at first not thinking too much of Sakuragi (who addresses him as \"Gori\" for gorilla due to his immense physical presence), he actually realizes Sakuragi's potential as a basketball player. Serious and disciplined, Akagi's dream is to lead Shohoku to the national championship. His determination is shown in the match against Kainan, where he played on despite a serious injury to his ankle. Akagi considers Uozumi of Ryonan to be his biggest rival, though their rivalry is not antagonistic; indeed, there is respect that borders on friendship.\n\nAkagi differs from the other starters in two respects. First, he is the most academically talented out of all them and is considered a model student. After the loss to Aiwa knocks Shohoku out of the Nationals, Akagi leaves the team along with Kogure to study for the college entrance exams. In contrast, the other four had to beg their teacher to be given the chance to retake some exams they had flunked; they would otherwise have been disqualified from playing in the Nationals for having failed too many classes. Second, Akagi is the only starter not to have gotten into an actual fight, although he has used physical force against his own players (most notably Sakuragi, and once Mitsui after the gym fight) to keep them in line. He is the only other character besides Rukawa able to take one of Sakuragi's trademark headbutts without being knocked out and the only other character who has had Sakuragi inadvertently dunk a ball on his head (Murasame of Miuradai was the second, in the manga; in the anime, the second one to be dunked on the head is Naito, also from Miuradai).\n\nRegarded as the best center in the Kanagawa prefecture, Akagi plays as a fairly typical center, using his height and power to score close to the basket. He also has a reputation for being a virtually unbeatable defender. As captain of the team, he keeps discipline among his players during matches. Akagi met his match during the game against Sannoh, in the form of Masashi Kawata, considered one of the best centers at the high school level. Initially intimidated when Kawata outplayed him, he regained his confidence thanks to Uozumi's encouragement and led his team to victory. \n\n(Source: hoopedia.nba.com)",

She is a young girl who attacked Yuuichi Aizawa out-of-the-blue in the middle of town early on in the story. She was then carried back to Yuuichi and Nayuki Minase's house, where she lived as a guest for the remainder of her story. Despite having lost her memories, she remembered what her name was and is sure of is that she holds a grudge against Yuuichi from the past when he visited the city back when he was younger. Makoto's amnesia, or memory loss, is much more severe than Yuuichi's or Ayu Tsukimiya's, but from an entirely different source. When it comes to her opinion on taking in small animals as pets, she feels sad that pets sometimes are abandoned when their owners cannot take care of them. Due to this attitude, it takes her a while to warm up to a stray cat she finds halfway through her story which she later names Piro. Makoto is shown to love Piro very much and will often carry the cat around on her head. \n\nFrom early on, it becomes obvious that Makoto has a mischievous personality, which leads to her performing various pranks. These are done exclusively on Yuichi because of her strong dislike for him, something she constantly reaffirms. Her persistent attempts at pranks on Yuuichi vary in severity, such as simply dropping food on him or once even throwing lit firecrackers in his room. As time passes and Makoto beings to feel more as a member of the Minase family rather than a stranger, she honestly grows to like Yuuichi, effectively looking beyond her latent distaste for him. \n\nMakoto can be clueless about things that people her age should know, such as the fact that she can buy her own meat buns and manga; Yuuichi had commented once how she lacked common sense due to a lack of social experience. Like Ayu, she too has an idiosyncratic expression, \"auu~\", which she says when she is frustrated or sad; likewise, it has no real meaning. Another unique speech pattern of hers is that she always refers to herself in the third person. Near the end of her story, Makoto starts to wear two bells around her right wrist and enjoys the sound they make. \n\nMakoto is in fact not a human being but instead a fox that Yuuichi found ten years prior to the beginning of the Kanon story. Yuuichi first found Makoto, then a young fox, injured on Monomi Hill and he took the fox back and kept it in his room for the rest of the summer. One day, Yuuichi tells the fox about an older girl that he had a crush on named Makoto Sawatari, which is where Makoto's name is derived from when the Kanon story is just beginning. At the end of summer break, Yuuichi takes the fox back to the hill, and he runs away soon after releasing her, leading her to be angry with Yuuichi. With her desire to see Yuuichi being so strong, her wish was granted at the cost of her memories and later her life. The two later reunite after the fox transforms into Makoto near the start of Kanon. \n\nMakoto dies after her fake marrying with Yuuichi.  \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Due to her disregard for what's considered \"normal behavior\", she's viewed as a delinquent by her peers. She holds a very close relationship with her fellow senior, Kurata Sayuri, and can usually be seen with her most of the time.\n\nWhen Mai was still a young girl, her mother fell ill. During this time of despair, Mai discovered a great inherent power; the ability to heal living creatures at will. This power rose her to child fame; however, the townspeople grew to fear her power as it was unusual. As a result, Mai was ostracized by everyone except her mother, and soon they were forced to move to another town. Mai was told that one day she would meet someone who would be able to put aside her powers and become a great friend, and that friend was Yuuichi.\n\r\nHowever it wasn't long before Yuuichi had to leave the town and return home. This caused Mai grief, and in her desperation she began to fabricate a story about monsters invading their favorite place to play together: a field of wheat. Later, the school was built on that field, and Mai continued to walk those grounds late at night, sword at the ready, fighting off the demons which manifested from her very own powers.\n\r\nIn the present day story, Yuuichi first meets Mai in a school corridor at night. It's after then that Yuuichi begins eating lunch with Sayuri and Mai on a regular basis. With Yuuichi and Sayuri's support Mai avoids expulsion from school, between broken windows from her nightly demon hunting and a battle that completely demolishes the school dance.\n\r\nEventually, Yuuichi would be at Mai's side in her final stand as she raged against the demons for hurting Sayuri, and defeat the malevolence generated by her past. She attempts to take her own life afterward, but fails and ends up recuperating in a hospital with Sayuri. \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She tends to answer yes and no very quickly, usually in one second. For example, when Makoto wanted to keep Piro, she said yes right after the question. Since, she is a mother, she can cook, clean, and will always be there if someone needs her. \n\nShe works at an unspecified job and takes care of the house, cooking various types of food, most of which is good except for her infamous \"special\" homemade jam which she alone enjoys the taste of. She appears to not realize exactly what is going on around her, taking in strays such as Makoto Sawatari and assuming lame excuses for her behavior. She may just realize that Makoto is a good person and can be cured of her anger, which is true. Akiko certainly exhibits more knowledge of the situation than Yuichi as far as the origins of Ayu Tsukimiya and Makoto are concerned, hinting that she is familiar with the supernatural goings-on in the town and how they apply to Yuichi. Akiko is very important to Nayuki since she does not have a father. Akiko is known to be very easy-going and is constantly smiling. She will not even resort to stern lectures, such as when Makoto spends money on herself that Akiko gave her to buy food. Akiko can be assertive, though she never has once raised her voice in anger or otherwise. She will often give responses to questions within one second of being asked, the answer almost always marking approval.\n\nAkiko has some indirect involvement with Makoto Sawatari's and Ayu Tsukimiya's arcs. After Yuichi brought Makoto home for the first time, Akiko shows no intentions of throwing her out or handing her over to the police. She decided to house Makoto for the time being until they could find her parents or until she remembered something. With Ayu, Akiko asked her to stay at their house upon discovering that both of Ayu's parents were out of town. Akiko's main involvement is with her daughter Nayuki's arc. From when Nayuki was very young, Akiko raised her daughter alone; no information is given about Nayuki's father or what happened to him after Nayuki's birth. As such, Akiko and Nayuki are very close and never get in fights with each other. \n\nIn Nayuki's story, Akiko gets critically injured in an indirect car accident which causes her to go into intensive care in the hospital. Nayuki, blaming herself because Akiko was out buying a small strawberry cake for her, goes into depression and pushes Yuichi away from her. Akiko is miraculously healed near the end of the story.\n\n(Source: Kanon Wiki)",

As Ritsuka discovers, Seimei's impromptu will dictates that Soubi shall \"become Ritsuka's\" upon his death. Ritsuka deeply admired and idolized Seimei, and to discover later there were many things kept secret came as a great shock. It further poisoned his difficulty in trusting others, particularly Soubi.\n\nDespite his young age and inexperience due to his amnesia, Ritsuka is very intelligent and approaches things with startling maturity. The circumstances of his life encourage his lack of innocence; however, there have been notable incidents that bare his still-strong naivety, particularly in sexual love and dating. Despite this, he still has firm opinions and unrelenting ideas about those subjects. It is these opinions that clash dramatically with adults and authority figures around him, most notably Soubi. Ritsuka is a pacifist, and strongly opposes violence under any circumstance. Soubi has remained fairly silent on the issue; however, he seemingly doesn't object to pain and punishment under certain circumstances.\n\nLove is an uncomfortable subject for Ritsuka. He is wary of compliments, and doesn't like hearing phrases such as \"I like you.\" Early on in the series, Soubi says \"I love you\" frequently, which Ritsuka doesn't believe is true. Because of Ritsuka's cynical reaction, Soubi stops saying it altogether after volume 2 of the manga. Still, Ritsuka's inner conflict over whether he believes what Soubi says becomes a source of great tension and bitterness in their relationship. More recent developments in the series revealed Soubi as the BELOVED imposter. Even after having knowledge of this, Ritsuka still insisted on remaining as Soubi's sacrifice. Ritsuka mentioned that he had always suspected this much about Soubi considering that Soubi constantly refused to disclose any information about himself and Seimei.\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He is the son of Echizen Nanjir\u014d and Takeuchi-Echizen Rinko. He first appears in chapter 1 when he criticized a high school student for the lesser knowledge of grips. \n\nBackground\n\r\nRyoma is a first year student at Seishun Academy ('Seigaku' for short), which he attends immediately after his arrival in Japan after formerly residing in the United States. Although only a first year in middle school, Ryoma had already earned notoriety through winning four consecutive titles in the American Junior Tennis tournaments \u2013 all in a little over a year. Due to his nearly invincible tennis play, Ryoma has earned the label 'prodigy' by the age of twelve. His looks and confidence make him highly popular with ladies, although he seems not to notice, having his focus exclusively on tennis.\n\r\nHe is an all-court tennis player with many special shots and abilities. One of Ryoma's greatest talents is his ability to learn new techniques after only seeing them performed a few times. He also has an amazing amount of stamina and does not sweat as much as the other players. Along with fellow Seigaku regular Eiji Kikumaru, Ryoma is known to have an exceptional talent for seeing moving objects. He does not go easy on himself and pushes himself more, rather than letting himself rest. He is specifically a singles player, though he did try doubles once with teammate Momoshiro Takeshi. After seeing how bad he was at doubles, Coach Ry\u016bzaki usually placed him in the S3 (Singles 3) or S2 (Singles 2) position. When captain Tezuka Kunimitsu goes away for rehabilitation for his arm, Ryoma and teammate Fuji Sh\u016bsuke take turns for the S1 (Singles 1) position. In the Nationals, Ryoma often found himself placed in the S1 position nearly every match.\n\r\nHis catchphrase (and favorite phrase) in the Japanese anime is \"Mada Mada Dane,\" literally meaning \"No, not yet\" or \"Not good enough,\" although the literal translation in Japanese is \"You still have lots more to work on.\" In the American version, it is translated as \"You still have a ways to go.\"\n\r\nIn the Prince of Tennis movie Tennis no \u014cjisama - Futari no Samurai, Ryoma supposedly has an older brother named Ry\u014dga Echizen, but the latter is later revealed to simply be a child that Nanjir\u014d took in a few years ago.\n\r\nIn the manga, Ryoma goes with his team to the Nationals. In the anime, he is chosen as a wildcard for the U.S. Open and goes to it, eventually beating Lleyton Hewitt in the finals. He comes back in the OVA, and although he says he wouldn't participate with Seigaku, vice captain Oishi Sh\u016bichiro goads him into a match to take over his spot as a regular, which Echizen does. Re-earning his spot, Ryoma leads the team to their first national victory. He returns to America afterwards, and returns in time for the U-17 Selection Camp. There, he learns that there are still more powerful people out there, and strives to become even stronger to defeat the likes of Tokugawa Kazuya.\n\nSource: Kuryujiru LJ and Prince of Tennis Wikia",

As the captain, he is very serious, and is strict when enforcing order within his team. Tezuka is the character who encourages the series' protagonist, Ryoma Echizen, to develop his own style of tennis, leading the latter to consider him to be both a mentor and a rival. Throughout the series, Tezuka constantly struggles with the pain in his left arm, which was caused by an injury inflicted upon him by an upperclassman two years prior. However, he is often willing to sacrifice his arm in order to defeat his opponent and lead his team to the Nationals.\n\nBackground\n\r\nKunimitsu Tezuka is introduced as the serious and strict third year captain of Seishun Academy's tennis club, who gives Ryoma Echizen a chance to become a regular by allowing him to participate in the Intraschool Rankings Tournament. Despite being known as Seigaku's \"strongest man\", he initially remains on the sidelines during tournaments, as another teammate would sometimes play in his usual position of singles 1 or his team usually defeats their opponents in straight sets. Though he secretly challenges and defeats Ryoma in an unofficial match in an attempt to reach his junior to become Seigaku's new \"pillar of support\", his true skills are first shown during an Intraschool Ranking match against Inui.\n\r\nThree years prior to the start of the story, a young Tezuka showed up after the Junior Tennis Tournament and easily beat the tournament's runner-up, Genichiro Sanada. The tournament champion, Seiichi Yukimura, challenged Tezuka to a match, but the winner is not revealed.\n\r\nAfter entering Seishun Academy, Tezuka was seen as overconfident and arrogant by the upperclassmen at Seigaku due to his talents and seriousness, especially when they discovered that he was left-handed even though he played with his right. A jealous teammate then injured Tezuka's left arm, leading to chronic problems, and his sealing of Hyaku Ren Jitoku no Kiwami, a technique which required the use of his left arm. Still, because of his skills, he was recognized by captain Yudai Yamato, who convinced Tezuka, who had decided to leave the club because he did not want to be on the same team as people who hurt others with their racquets, to become Seigaku's \"pillar of support\". This, along with the promise he made with teammate Shuichiro Oishi, in which Tezuka promised to lead Seigaku to the Nationals, encouraged him to stay in the tennis club. Shusuke Fuji later requested a match against Tezuka, and though Tezuka was defeated, Fuji was displeased with the outcome after finding out about Tezuka's injury. The two promise to play each other once again after Tezuka's arm completely heals.\n\r\nAfter a while, Tezuka became a team regular despite being a freshman. By his second year, he became the team's vice-captain, and defeated Hyotei Academy's captain in the Tokyo Prefectural Tournament. He was invited to the Junior Senbatsu tennis training camp, but because his arm problems returned, he declined the invitation without stating his reasons to the organization.\n\r\nThe first serious official tournament match he plays is against Hyotei's captain, Keigo Atobe. Though the return of Tezuka's arm injury causes him to collapse in pain, he refuses to give up, and after a long and tedious tie-break, the game ends with Atobe victorious, marking Tezuka's first loss in an official singles match. Tezuka then decides to go to Kyushu in order to receive medical treatment for his injuries at a health clinic near Seishun University. While Tezuka overcomes his fear of feeling the pain in his shoulder, he continues to support his team, sometimes discussing the team's lineup for upcoming matches over the phone.\n\r\nIn the anime, Tezuka recovers at a renown sports clinic in Germany at Ryuzaki Sumire's recommendation. He plays one last match against Ryoma before he leaves, using is right hand for the whole match. Tezuka takes time to adapt his Tezuka Zone for his right hand and finishes Ryoma off with a right-handed Zero-Shiki Drop Shot, challenging Ryoma to adapt to a player who can evolve during the match.\n\r\nHe returns right before the National Tournament, where he unseals his Hyaku Ren Jitoku no Kiwami, to defeat Higa Middle School's captain, Eishiro Kite. Tezuka goes on to defeat Hyotei's Munehiro Kabaji. In the National semi-finals, despite it being a doubles match, Tezuka plays one-on-one against Shitenhoji's Senri Chitose; their partners step aside in order for them to play with their full power. After unveiling his new Zero-Shiki Serve, as well as revealing that he has opened Saiki Kanpatsu no Kiwami, Tezuka wins.\n\r\nBefore the final match of tournament against Rikkai Junior High School, Tezuka tells Oishi that he plans to go to Germany in order to become a professional tennis player after this tournament. During his match against Genichiro Sanada, Tezuka unveils his Tezuka Phantom, however, this, combined with the continuous use of the Zero-Shiki Serve, damages Tezuka's arm, creating a weakness which Sanada soon uses to his advantage. A cord ball by Tezuka which drops from the net to his side, results in Sanada's victory. However, in the end, after Ryoma's win against Rikkai's captain Seiichi Yukimura, Tezuka finally achieves his goal of turning Seishun Academy into the National champions, and smiles for the first time.\n\r\nSome time later, Tezuka, along with the rest of the Seigaku regulars as well as several other middle schoolers, were invited to the Under-17 Training Camp, where he, along with his fellow middle schoolers, were placed in a tie-breaker style elimination match that the middle schoolers thought of pairing up for doubles. Tezuka paired up with his protege, Kaido Kaoru, and tried to convey him the message of being the next captain of Seigaku, and defeated him 7-0.\r\n(Source: Prince of Tennis Wikia)",

He is voiced by Yuki Kaida in the original version of the anime, and voiced by Adam Lawson in the English dubbed version until episode 31, where he is replaced by Johnny Yong Bosch.\n\nBackground\n\r\nSh\u016bsuke Fuji is a third year student at Seishun Academy. He is given the title \"tensai\", or genius, due to his tactical skill on the tennis court. He is in the same class as  Eiji Kikumaru, and is Eiji's good friend. Fuji is a leap year baby (his birthday is on February 29), and thus he can only properly celebrate his birthday once every four years. Fuji is cheerful and easygoing, with a penchant for playfully teasing those around him.\n\r\nHe is the middle child of the Fuji family. His unnamed father is a foreign-based employee, and is never seen in the series. His mother, 49-year-old Yoshiko, who also has perpetually-closed eyes, is seen in the manga as a kind and dedicated Japanese housewife. His younger brother, Y\u016bta, is a tennis player at St. Rudolph Middle School. Fuji's older sister, 24-year-old Yumiko, is considered very attractive and is popular among both Fuji and Y\u016bta's friends.\n\r\nHe grew up in Chiba, where he became friends with Kojir\u014d Saeki, the current vice-captain of Rokkaku Middle School Tennis Club. Later on, he moved to Tokyo and entered Seigaku.\n\r\nFuji usually takes the position of S2 (Singles 2), although sometimes he is paired with Kawamura Takashi or Kikumaru Eiji in Doubles (with Kikumaru, they are called the \"Dream Pair\"). Also, he and Echizen Ryoma temporarily take turns for the position of S1 (Singles 1) when captain Tezuka Kunimitsu is in rehabilitation.\r\n(Sources: Kuryujiru Live Journal, Prince of Tennis Wikia)",

He is an intelligent player and is best known for collecting player data, which he incorporates into a unique playing style known as \"Data Tennis\".\n\nFour years prior to the start of the series, Inui and Yanagi Renji were an unstoppable Elementary School Doubles Pairing. Despite Inui wanting to continue their close partnership, their doubles pairing was ended when Yanagi suddenly moved to the Kanagawa Prefecture and joined [[|Rikkai Dagaku Fuzoku |Rikkaidai]].\n\r\nBefore Echizen Ryoma's arrival at Seigaku, Inui was recognised as the third-strongest player on the team, next to Fuji Sh\u016bsuke and Tezuka Kunimitsu. Inui has an intense rivalry with Tezuka, having played at least 30 matches against him and losing every single one of them. In response to Tezuka's superiority, Inui began developing his style of Data Tennis specifically to defeat Tezuka.\n\r\nDespite being in the regular lineup for six months, Inui was beaten by Ryoma in the intra-school ranking tournament, and then lost to Kaid\u014d Kaoru (who had also been beaten earlier by Echizen and was determined not to lose his spot) at the beginning of the series. He later became the team's manager. He uses his data to create exercise programs for the team.\n\r\nEventually, Inui is able to make it back as a regular by using the data he obtained over the time he was manager, defeating Momohsiro Takeshi to regain his spot in the regulars. Despite his guaranteed spot, he played a tough match against the undefeated Tezuka and again lost to his captain. Nonetheless, Inui is enthusiastic about regaining his spot on the team, and is eager to practice with his teammates and resume his data-gathering.\n\r\nWhile he is a very good singles player, Inui usually plays doubles with various partners, most notably his proteg\u00e9 Kaid\u014d Kaoru. His doubling with Kaid\u014d helped Seigaku overcome their problems with their lack of strong doubles teams, with the exception of the Golden Pair.\r\n(Source: Kuryujiru LJ and Prince of Tennis Wikia)",

While his play style becomes more aggressive as the series progresses, his original style is still evident in his matches.\n\nBackground\n\r\nKaid\u014d is mostly known for his \"Snake Shot\" (derived from the \"Buggy Whip Shot\"), a curving forehand that keeps his opponents running. He later develops the \"Boomerang Snake,\" which is a shot that swerves out of bounds, around the net pole, and back in bounds. He developed the shot under mentor Sadaharu Inui's advice and by working with him in doubles. He usually plays the Singles 3 position, though he is most often placed in one of the Doubles slots.\n\r\nIn Genius 379, the last chapter of the manga, Kaid\u014d is seen as a third year and the new captain of Seigaku, with Momoshiro as his sub-captain. Their rivalry has, apparently, somewhat mellowed with time.\r\nAs akid he cried a lot. When he was in kindergarten, he was often mistaken for a girl, called Kaoru-chan, and forced to wear a skirt.\n\r\n(Source: Kuryujiru LJ and Prince of Tennis Wikia)",

She is the daughter of a wealthy family, and always tries to smile and help others. She uses more formal Japanese honorifics for Yuichi when she addresses him, even when they become close friends. Sayuri cares very deeply about Mai, as it shows since they not only hang out together constantly, but Sayuri will get worried if Mai is in trouble; she also never forgets Mai's birthday. Initially, she is completely ignorant about the demons but even though some begin to target her near the end of Mai's story, she stubbornly stays by Mai's side. Sayuri, as with Ayu and Makoto, has a cute quirk; when she laughs, she voices a distinct Ahaha. Sayuri always addresses herself in the third person due to an event in her past.\n\n\r\nIn episode 14, Sayuri reveals that had a littler brother, Kazuya. Sayuri was raised by her dad to always have good manners and when Kazuya was born, she adopted a tough love approach to raising him and treated him strictly so he will grow up to become strong. However, she really wanted to play with him and give him what he wanted and see him smile. Kazuya then suddenly became sick. When Kazuya's condition worsened, Sayuri went out to buy water pistols and snacks for him and played together with him. According to Sayuri, this was the \"first and last memory of playing together.\" When Kazuya dies, Sayuri starts to refer to herself in the third person since she can only view herself objectively.",

Even though he did not achieve his goal of becoming first nationally during high school in the 100 meters, he was scouted and recommended to attend two universities: Touto University and Seijo University. After being released from his promise with Saki and realizing that he was still in love with Asahina, he decided to try for acceptance to Seijo University. When he confessed to Suzuka that he wanted to restart their relationship, she stated that she did not because of the fear of getting hurt. Through patience, understanding, and persistence, they made up. During Seijo University's track tryouts, Yamato performed poorly at the start of his race, but showed enough potential at the end for the Selection Committee to unanimously choose him for the scholarship. Pressured by Yasunobu, Yamato decided to take his relationship to the next level. Suzuka initially was against it, but Yamato sets her at ease and they take a step forward in the relationship. Three months later, he learns that Suzuka is pregnant. He is troubled by the decision of her having an abortion and going to the University or keeping the baby and skipping school to work. He admitted to Suzuka that he wants her to keep the baby. After much discussion between the two they both decided to keep the baby and get married, and decided to drop out of the university. They have a daughter named Fuuka.\nIn the sequel of the manga named Fuuka, it is revealed that Yamato will win the silver medal on the olympics 100 meter while finally beating Arima who took bronze.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Because of her past with Kazuki, she was reluctant to express her feelings toward Yamato and ended up trying to push him away. After a while, she finally admits to herself and to Yamato that she has liked him since the first time they met, and they begin dating. Their relationship was rocky from the start because of Yamato\u2019s carelessness and Suzuka's guarded attitude to her thoughts and feelings. She decides to take the offer to study abroad from Sasoka, claiming the training standards are higher and she will benefit more, but it was really because Yamato complimented her on how cool she looked during her high-jump. After the time-skip, Suzuka moved back into her room next door to Yamato. She, like Yamato, was recommended to Seijo University, which she plans on attending. After Yamato told her he wanted to rekindle their relationship, she was against the idea because she was afraid that if they date again, they will begin to hate each other and drift apart. When Yamato shows his devotion to her, they get back together. Things once again became unsettled after Yamato tries to further their relationship to a physical one. She reacted by slapping him when he groped her. After he apologies, she stated that she was simply nervous of the idea, but that if he wanted to, she would take that step forward. After being caught on their secret trip by her father, she is forced to move back home. During this time she feels ill. After Yamato works out the problems with her father, he convinces her to go get the illness checked out. When she comes out, she reveals that the illness was actually morning sickness, as she is three months pregnant. After much discussion between the two they both decided to keep the baby and get married, and decided to drop out of the university. Even though Yamato has to get employed to support his new family, Suzuka wants him to get a job in a company which has a track team. Just recently, their child was revealed to be a girl named Fuuka.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "In the 2003 anime series\r\nGreed is the second oldest of the Homunculi created by Dante. However, due to his avarice, Greed rebelled and was eventually captured and imprisoned in lab 5. He was imprisoned for 130 years until an explosion broke his seal. He then freed the caged chimera at Lab 5 in exchange for helping him get his revenge on the other homunculi and their master.\n\nIn the manga and 2009 anime series\r\nHe is the third Homunculus created by Father. Greed apparently abandoned the other Homunculi over 100 years before the start of the series and claims to be around two centuries old. He first appears hiding in the Devil's Nest in Dublith, with his gang of chimeras all of whom he apparently rescued from military experimentation. \n\nAfter Greed is punished by Father, he later returns as Father removes his son's Philosophers Stone core from his own body and inserts it directly into the body of Ling Yao to create a second Human-based Homunculus. This second Greed maintains all the same personality and powers as the first (his Ouroboros tattoo is even in the same spot), but appears to have none of his previous memories, not recognizing Envy, Gluttony or the Elric Brothers. As such, he becomes a faithful servant of his Father, as the first Greed was presumed to have been initially, and refers to all actions prior to his rebirth as having been done by \"the other Greed\".\n\r\nHowever, as Greed is a host in Ling Yao's body, Ling is able to regain control of his body if Greed let's his guard down or allows him to. By doing this, Ling is able to regain his sixth sense of detecting another's presence, but is not able to use the Ultimate Shield. Greed is reluctant to willingly give him back his body however.\n\r\nAfter killing a past comrade and follower of his, memories from Greed's previous life returned, including his time in the Devil's Nest and the feelings he had for his followers. Remembering this, along with how Bradly killed most of his followers, leads Greed to betraying Father once again. He also stops referring to his \"previous self\" as \"the other Greed\" upon regaining his memories.\n\r\nAfter forming a temporary alliance with Edward and company, Greed and Ling help in the fight against the Homunculi and the Central Troopers. In the afternath, as Edward, Alphonse and the military engage Father, he steps in and allows Father to absorb his Philosopher's Stone, afterwards giving Ling his body back, claiming the only thing he truly wanted were friends. He then reverses his Ultimate Sheild, turning Father into a brittle coal-like substance and fades away with his Father, a smile on his face.\r\n(Source: Fullmetal Alchemist Wikia)",

    "description": "Height: 175 cm (5'8.5\")\r\nWeight: 62 kg (136.4 lbs)\r\nSpecialty: sculptures\n\r\nMorita occupies room 203, his floormates being Takemoto and Hasegawa. Morita is unable to graduate, as he can never wake up on time to go to classes. This is mainly due to the work that he does, which forces him to go missing for periods of time. What he does for work though remains a mystery. When Morita comes back from his mysterious job, he immediately falls asleep for at least 48 hours, due to the amount of work he does. He also returns with a large sum of money in his back-pocket and brings a food item to share with his flat mates. Although the flat mates believe he does it to mock them, such as when he brings a bag of croquettes instead of meat, Morita does care deeply for his friends such as Takemoto.\n\r\nMorita is a very mysterious person. He does many random, crazy things for his personal enjoyment, such as creating a twister game with too many colors, which resulted in horrific pain for him and Takemoto. Morita is a perceptive individual, but tactless and often states the truth, such as how Mayama secretly stalks Rika outside her apartment, when nobody wants to hear it. He also expresses his love for Hagu in weird and quirky ways, such as forcing Hagu to dress up as a mouse. Morita's obsession with Hagu stems from a fondness of cute things during his childhood, such as causing a cat to become neurotic after cuddling it too much. \n\nAs a result of Morita's obsession Hagu becomes afraid of him and tries to avoid him but eventually falls in love with him later on. Despite the way Morita treats Hagu he sincerely cares for Hagu, getting her a pair of expensive mules and creating a broach with a dove on it, both of which was in her scrapbook of things she wanted.\n\r\nLater in the series, Morita leaves for America for work without saying anything to his friends. He eventually returns in about a year's time, and Morita's friends finally discover what he does for his work, being awarded best CGI in the Mocademy Awards (a spoof of the Academy Awards) for the movie 'Space Titanic', after studying with acclaimed director Peter Lucas. Morita's room, which no one had ever been inside, had also been discovered after his departure, and contained a lot of high tech equipment.\n\r\nAfter returning from America, Morita finally manages to graduate from his course in his 8th year handing his work in on the very last day. Despite graduating and becoming rich from his work in America, Morita applies for a Japanese Arts course believing he hasn't studied for long enough, even though he's been there for 8 years. He re-enters the art school as a 3rd grade student, having already completed half the subjects.\nTowards the end of the series, it is revealed that Morita's money-making as well as his work in Hollywood with director Peter Lucas were all part of a plan to take over the man who took over his father's company. The plan was masterminded by his brother Kaoru and old employees of Morita's father with Morita's part being the money and getting Peter Lucas (a shareholder) on their side. Morita is seen to be against the whole plan because his father told both him and Kaoru not to hold a grudge and move on with their lives, Morita wanted to follow his father's advice but Kaoru didn't. Because of Morita's deep love and respect for his brother, he agreed to do his part of the plan. However, once they succeeded in ruining the man who took over their father's company, he becomes greatly depressed, hating his talent and turning to Hagu when she was about to lose the ability in her working hand. Morita tries to take her down with him, for both of them to leave their talent behind, saying that \"just being together is enough\". At the end, Hagu's determination as well as her choosing Hanamoto-sensei makes Morita make up his mind about his future, he helps out the family of the man they ruined to take revenge on their father, makes up with his brother and decides to work for Peter Lucas, who he say reminds him of his father. He still loves Hagu and sets up a webcam for her to always be watching him as she promised him.",

    "description": "Specialty: All mediums of art\r\nLikes: Initially Unknown\r\nHeight: 142 cm (4'6\")\r\nWeight: 38 kg (83.6 lbs)\n\r\nA supremely gifted artist, Hagu's immense talents are esteemed by all who witness her works, catching the eye of numerous professional artists who insistently urge her to submit her work to exhibitions to heighten her publicity (which she seems to find daunting). She is 18 years of age at the beginning of the series and her appearance is that of a child, and she conveniently behaves as one. Raised in a largely sheltered and obscure home by her irritable grandmother, her sociability is below average. It is whilst living in that home that Hagu develops her skill in drawing and painting, her only past-time, though she finds nothing to sketch save for the never-changing view she has from her porch, varying only in seasons. Hagu is from Azumino city, Nagano-ken.\n\nShe is introduced to Takemoto, Morita and Mayama by Sh\u016bji, her mother's cousin and also a professor at the college. Upon seeing her, Morita and Takemoto fall in love with her, though both express it in different ways. Hagu knows not of their feelings towards her, but sees them as friends. However, Morita expresses his love for her in very odd ways, and Hagu is often seen trying to escape from whatever shenanigan Morita has planned for her. Though later Hagu develops feelings towards Morita, although she does not at first realize this, as Sh\u016bji points out.\n\r\nHagu is very shy, and because she is so nervous when interacting with people, the other art students think that she is strange. Hagu doesn't seem to be too close with family members either, with the exception of Sh\u016bji, whom she fondly calls \"Sh\u016b-chan.\" However, as the series progresses, Hagu is able to become closer friends with Takemoto, Mayama, Morita and Yamada. When Sh\u016bji leaves to go do a research project in Mongolia, Hagu forms a deeper bond with each of them, essentially seeing them as a sort of family. Hagu lives with Yamada (whom she calls \"Ayu\") when Sh\u016bji is away and they become very close friends.\n\r\nDuring parties, she is seen to be crying because of her envy of Yamada's beautiful legs and beautiful breasts. Mayama tries very hard to comfort her but failing rather miserably saying that \"You'll have one of those when you're older....probably.\" While Hagu is crying, Morita is also crying because of her infectious tears.\n\r\nLater in the series, Hagu started to avoid Takemoto after he confessed his feelings for her, leaving doubts if his love for her is reciprocated or not. In the latest manga chapters she admits that she likes Morita, but would rather be with Sh\u016bji because she knows that he can take care of her (especially after a life-altering accident that may permanently impair her abilities as an artist).",

He is from Annaka city, Gunma-ken. He lives in the same apartment complex as Mayama and Morita in room 202. His floormates are Morita and Hasegawa. Takemoto studies architecture, but has little certainty as to what he wishes to do upon graduating; his decision to attend art college was because he liked to build things with his hands, like he had with his father.\n\r\nTakemoto is one of the more mellow characters in the series. He falls in love with Hagu immediately after being introduced by his professor and keeps his feelings to himself throughout most of the series. His love for Hagu and his inability to act upon his feelings as freely as Morita causes some internal problems for Takemoto. For example, when Hagu received a bird brooch that was made for her as an anonymous present, Takemoto couldn't bring himself to say that Morita was the one who had made it for her. Instead of acting on his feelings, Takemoto decides to be more of a brother figure to Hagu, giving her friendly support when needed. For example, Takemoto accepts Hagu's requests to build her sophisticated dollhouses and the like. Takemoto is very close to her.\n\r\nHis relationship with his family also contributes to his mellow mood. His father died when he was still young. Also, his mother works at a hospital as a nurse, so Takemoto would usually spend a lot of his time there, even his Christmas holidays. Furthermore, Takemoto is uncomfortable with his mother's new husband, an outspoken man whose persona seems to a polar opposite to that of his father. However, Takemoto tries to get used to his company and tries to accept the fact that his step-father is capable of looking after his mother, since Takemoto has worried about his mother's well-being ever since he left home. His mother's remarriage and her assurance that he is now free to do as he wishes instead of taking care of her all the time later influenced Takemoto's decision to attend art college.\n\r\nLater in the series, Takemoto has to stay another year due to getting a stomach ulcer and not being able to complete his graduation thesis.\n\nDuring the end of the first season, Takemoto goes on a journey across Japan on a bicycle, meeting several people on the way, including a group in Zuigan-ji in Matsushima which is involved in the renovating of ancient Japanese structures and buildings all around the country (which he wishes to join), finally reaching Cape S\u014dya in Wakkanai, Hokkaid\u014d. After arriving back to Tokyo, he finally confesses his feelings for Hagu, but she did not have the courage to answer him, thus Takemoto figured his feelings for her were unrequited.",

It is unknown whether Rika fully reciprocates the feelings that Mayama has for her, but various flashbacks imply that Mayama and Rika have 'fooled around', or Mayama took advantage of Rika's disability to fulfill his desires, although this is cleared up later as not being the case. Rika suggested that Mayama find another job so that she wouldn't have to continue hurting him, as she realizes how much he cares for her, and is unable (and perhaps unwilling at that point) to allow him to enter into her life.\n\r\nMayama eventually landed a job at Fujiwara Design. He has to deal with coworkers that are also very interested in his love life, and make comments whenever they can. Mayama also has to keep watch of his boss, Nomiya, whom he considers to be a playboy, when Nomiya begins to take an interest in Yamada.\n\r\nMayama doesn't return the feelings that Yamada has for him, but he sees Yamada as his close friend. Yamada's innocence is one thing that Mayama has to constantly guard from Nomiya, who has developed an interest with her.\n\r\nWhen Fujiwara Design later broke up, people had to either stay in the Tokyo branch or transfer to the Tottori branch. Nomiya arranged for Mayama to be transfer to the Tottori branch, but as soon as this was announced Mayama quit. He now works again with Rika at her company, Harada Design, after forcing himself into the position in his own way.\r\nMayama's character design is based upon Suga Shikao.",

He warmed up to Tooru very quickly, even ignoring the fact that he was a Zodiac and hugged her when they were formally introduced. Much to Kyo's horror, Momiji likes to wear the girl's version of their high school uniform, albeit with short shorts and not a skirt. Momiji sometimes sees Tooru at work and helps her clean. He even did Tooru's share once when she was sick with a cold. Momiji also develops feelings for Tooru. He tends to cross dress a lot.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited)",

It's his job to erase the memories of those who discover the Sohma clan secret, though it is not entirely clear if this is simply a form of hypnosis or more of a supernatural power. When his curse activates he turns into a seahorse rather than an actual dragon, because the Chinese consider the seahorse to be baby dragons and the actual name in Japanese translates to it. He is very self-conscious about his transformation in the fact that he is the \"great and powerful dragon\" but appears as a \"seahorse.\" He has had a bad experience in love with his \"Spring,\" a woman named Kana who was the assistant in his office. The relationship ended when Hatori asked Akito to give him permission to marry Kana. Akito threw a pot at Hatori and left him almost blind in the left eye. Kana felt so guilty about the incident and blamed herself completely. She was eventually driven insane with depression and guilt to the point where Hatori was forced to erase her memory in order to ease her suffering. Like Shigure and Ayame, he is very tall, and he is really a nice guy upon deeper inspection.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

His fear, coincidentally, is a fear of being totally alone. Much to Yuki's chagrin and surprise, he was actually the student body president in high school. When Ayame was young, he did not care for Yuki at all until he realized that when he got older, he would be totally alone without Yuki, spurring his new obsession to gaining Yuki's love shown in the series.

Aika also commonly addresses her as \"Kohai-chan\" (\u5f8c\u8f29\u3061\u3083\u3093 - or \"junior\" said in a friendly manner).\n\nOf the three girls, Alice is actually the first to become a prima, efficiently sidestepping the single/journeyman status and earning herself the nickname \"Orange Princess\" (as seen above.) Alice not becoming a single might be because she was going to school, and because Orange Planet didn't want to burden her with the addition of potentially being able to take on customers when accompanied by a Prima, as she arguably had the talent to become a single even before she met Akari and Aika. (Since the single test is basically rowing up the canal to the Hill of Hope.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

When Misuzu was younger, she was forced onto Haruko after her biological mother died and her father left her. Haruko loves Misuzu as her own child; however, she distances herself from Misuzu in the fear that if they became too close, it would hurt all the more if she gets taken away. Haruko enjoys drinking and riding her motorcycle which she often crashes into the garage after work. She also has many part-time jobs instead of one full-time job.\n\nHaruko is first introduced when Misuzu brings Yukito home and asks if he can stay. Although distrustful at first, Haruko soon trusts him and forces him to drink with her. When Misuzu breaks down crying, Haruko explains to Yukito of her disease and Misuzu's past with her father. She also explains her fear of Misuzu getting taken away and says that she distances herself from Misuzu to not get attached.\n\nWhen Yukito leaves and Misuzu's condition gets worse, Haruko decides to officially adopt Misuzu instead of living in fear and restricting their relationship. However when Misuzu's real father appears to take her with him, Haruko is sent into despair after finally allowing herself to hope for a family. After Misuzu rejects her father to stay with Haruko, she begins to act more like a mother and spend more time with Misuzu, but because of Misuzu's condition she isn't able to do much. One day, when Misuzu asks if they can go to the beach, Haruko happily accepts; however, when they get there, Misuzu dies in Haruko's arms, leaving her to cry at what they could have done now that they were a proper family.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "name": "Lelouch Lamperouge",
    "description": "Date of Birth: December 5, 2000 a.t.b. (Sagittarius)\r\nBlood Type: A\r\nNationality: Britannian\r\nHeight: 178-183 cm\r\nWeight: 56 kg\r\nOccupation: Ashford Academy Student\r\nKnown Relatives: Charles zi Britannia (father), Marianne vi Britannia (mother, deceased), Nunnally vi Britannia (little sister)\r\nAlter-Ego: Zero\r\nAllegiance: Order of the Black Knights\r\nPosition: Order of the Black Knights Leader\r\nKnightmare Frame: Burai, Gawain, Shinkiro\r\nFavourite quote: The only ones who should kill, are those who are prepared to be killed.\n\r\nLelouch is introduced in the first episode of the series as a student of Ashford Academy high school, where he is a member of its student council. A brilliant thinker who is quite talented at chess, he lives with his younger sister, Nunnally, with their maid, Sayoko Shinozaki, at a house situated within the compounds of Ashford Academy, where they are looked after by the Ashford family.\n\r\nLelouch is soon swept into the conflict between the Britannia Empire and the pockets of resistance which oppose it when he accidentally boards a truck being used by Japanese resistance operatives. Within the truck is a capsule holding C.C., who sacrifices herself to save him from the military forces trying to recapture her. When it seems as if her sacrifice was pointless, C.C. suddenly touches his hand and offers him the \"Power of the King,\" the mythical power of Geass. The Geass manifests itself in him as the power of absolute obedience, which allows him to make people obey his orders without question.\n\r\nWith his new power, Lelouch begins his rebellion against the Empire, forming the Order of the Black Knights and takes up the identity of Zero to lead them, becoming a revolutionary and gaining popular support amongst the people.\n\nLelouch is the son of the Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia, and the late Imperial Consort Marianne, making Lelouch the eleventh prince of the Britannian Imperial Family. He was seventeenth in line for the throne prior to his mother's assassination and his sister's crippling in the same incident. A ten-year-old Lelouch confronted the Emperor afterward and accused him of leaving his mother defenseless, even going as far as renouncing his entitlement to the throne. In response, his father banished him to Japan, where he was used as a political hostage in the Sakuradite conflict.\n\r\nIt was during his stay at the Kururugi household that he first met Suzaku Kururugi, with whom the young Lelouch did not interact initially in a friendly manner, before later becoming friends. However, when Britannia finally developed its Knightmare Frames fleet and decided to invade Japan to seize control of the Sakuradite mines, consequently discarding Lelouch's use as a diplomatic tool, Lelouch, fearing for his and his sister's safety, hid their true identities and sought the help of the Ashford family, who were his mother's allies.\n\r\nHis mother's death and his father's apparent lack of concern in regards to it were huge blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister, and therefore made it his goal to pursue a better world for Nunnally. He also seeks to discover the true reason for his mother's death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all.\n\r\nShortly after gaining the power of Geass from C.C., Lelouch assumes the secret identity Zero, a mysterious, masked revolutionary dressed in a black helmet and cloak. The helmet has a retractable plate over the left eye so Lelouch can use his Geass. In this guise, he forms the Order of the Black Knights, initially composed of the members of Kallen K\u014dzuki's resistance group. The goal of this vigilante group is a campaign against powerful individuals who oppress the helpless, which he eventually expands into reforming Japan as an independent nation.\n\r\nLelouch is willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish his goal, even if it means lying to his followers and using people as bait for the outcome he desires. However, he has trouble putting those he is close to in harms way for the sake of his goal, which is a weakness as a commander but a remnant of his humanity and sanity. His feelings for Nunnally in particular often hinders his plans, particularly at the end of the first season, where he abandons a massive war with Britannian forces to rescue her. Gradually, however, he has come to embrace the fact that he has to destroy before reconstruction can occur, even if it means harming those he cares about.\n\r\nOriginally, Lelouch is motivated by the desire to avenge his mother's death and construct an ideal world where his sister Nunnally can live in peace. After Nunnally becomes Viceroy of Area 11, and her wishes conflict with his goals, his friends help him to realize that his rebellion is no longer just for Nunnally, but for all the people of the world. Following Nunnally's death and the betrayal of the Black Knights, Lelouch focuses on making sure that he at least takes the Emperor down with him.\n\r\nThe turning point in his rebellion comes when Euphemia li Britannia declares the region under Mount Fuji the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, giving the Japanese people their name and country back, albeit in a much smaller area. This effectively destroys any possibility of the Black Knights' rebellion; acceptance would render them powerless and refusal would make them pariahs. Lelouch confronts her at the opening ceremony and tries to have her shoot him, hoping to make himself a martyr. When she says she plans to give up her title, he surrenders and agrees to work with her. However, at this moment his Geass permanently activates, and an offhand comment about ordering her to kill the Japanese forces her to do just that. Lelouch reluctantly kills her and uses the massacre as an excuse to declare Japan an independent nation. He then leads an attack on the Tokyo Settlement. The attack goes well at first, but when Lelouch learns that Nunnally has been kidnapped, he abandons the battle, leaving his forces helpless against the much better organized Britannian forces.\n\r\nLelouch and C.C. make their way to Kaminejima to search for Nunnally, where Lelouch is confronted by Suzaku Kururugi. Lelouch attempts to broker a truce, but Suzaku is distraught over the death of Euphemia and refuses to listen. An angered Lelouch draws his pistol and both Lelouch and Suzaku attempt to shoot one another. A single gunshot is heard as the screen fades to black at the end of the first season.\nSeason Two:\nOne year later, Lelouch is living a peaceful life with his younger brother, Rolo Lamperouge, and has no memory of his revolutionary activities, his Geass, Nunnally, his mother, or his royal lineage. Flashbacks reveal that neither Suzaku or Lelouch managed to kill one another. Instead, Lelouch was apprehended and brought before the Emperor, who used his own Geass to wipe Lelouch's memories and suppress his power.\n\r\nLelouch's memories and Geass are restored by C.C., and he resumes leadership of the Black Knights. To prevent retaliation by the Britannian forces, he makes his base in the Chinese Federation's consulate. When Nunnally is appointed as Viceroy of Area 11, and announces her plans to reestablish the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, Lelouch falls into depression since he would be impeding her wishes by continuing his rebellion. He nearly begins taking Refrain before Kallen stops him. With the help of Kallen and his friends at the Ashford Academy, Lelouch realizes that his mission no longer revolves solely around Nunnally, but concerns the rest of his friends, and the Japanese people as well. To solve both concerns, Lelouch engineers the legal exile of the Black Knights by getting the Britannians to agree to exile Zero in exchange for bringing one million participants for Nunnally's new Japan. By having them all dress as Zero, he forces Suzaku to exile them all rather than order a massacre. Sayoko stays behind as his body double to keep up the illusion that Lelouch and Zero are separate people, though during her short tenure as his impersonator she changes his image into that of an athletic womanizer.\n\r\nThe Black Knights escape to the Chinese Federation, where Lelouch begins his plans to win more countries to his side, creating a alliance that can match the Britannian Empire. He starts by overthrowing the High Eunuchs of the Chinese Federation and returning control to Empress Tianzi. He also has a secondary motive in doing so: the Chinese Federation is where V.V.'s Geass Directorate is headquartered. By taking control of the directorate, Lelouch believes he will be able to match the Emperor in both military and Geass might. While the remaining dissident forces are cleaned up, Lelouch returns to Japan to prepare for the invasion by installing Gefjun Disturbers in the mass transit rail system. The combined effect of every train running a Disturber would shut down Tokyo Settlement completely.\n\r\nAfter Shirley is killed by Rolo, Lelouch abandons his plan to take over the Geass Directorate, instead mounting an all-out assault on their stronghold. He orders the deaths of everyone within, resulting in the death of General Bartley among countless others. V.V. tries to use the Siegfried to buy time for the remaining members to escape, but it is destroyed with the aid of Cornelia while C.C. annihilates the remaining followers. Lelouch chases V.V. back into the temple, where he is unexpectedly teleported to the Sword of Akasha to face the Emperor. Lelouch attempts to kill the Emperor, but he has become immortal like C.C. The Emperor tells Lelouch about the world's lies, and shortly after C.C. arrives, finally revealing the contents of their pact. She would have had Lelouch kill her and take on her immortality, but instead spares him by placing him inside her memories while the Emperor kills her. Lelouch refuses to let her die unhappy and convinces her to live on. Lelouch destroys part of the Sword of Akasha and is transported back to the real world with C.C., but her memories of her life after gaining Geass have been erased.\n\r\nLelouch then completes ratifying the United Federation of Nations, and their first act is to liberate Japan. To insure Nunnally's safety, Lelouch agrees to meet Suzaku alone at the Kururugi Shrine. Suzaku demands answers about Lelouch's various uses of Geass, but Lelouch lies, claiming that everything he has ever done was purely for selfish reasons. Suzaku realizes that Lelouch is lying and agrees to help, but Prince Schneizel's troops move in to arrest Lelouch, convincing him that Suzaku sold him out. Lelouch escapes with the help of Guilford, having used his Geass to make Guilford see him as Princess Cornelia, and uses the Gefjun Disturber trains to shut down Tokyo Settlement. He resolves to abandon his emotions in order to achieve his goals, having lost his faith in friendship.\n\r\nIn the second battle of Tokyo, Lelouch directs his forces to focus on the government building in an effort to secure Nunnally. Suzaku threatens to use the F.L.E.I.J.A. bomb unless Lelouch stands down, but Lelouch merely waves him off as a liar. Once Kallen escapes in her upgraded Guren and Suzaku becomes an obstacle, Lelouch orders her to kill him. As her Knightmare is far more advanced, she nearly succeeds. Suzaku's imminent defeat activates his Geass command, causing him to launch F.L.E.I.J.A. The bomb engulfs the government complex, killing Nunnally among countless others. Lelouch goes into a nervous breakdown at the thought, refusing to believe that Nunnally could be dead. His identity is then exposed by Schneizel and the Black Knights betray him. Rolo evacuates him, but dies in the attempt. In the end, Lelouch comes to terms with his feelings for Rolo. Having lost everything as retribution for his acts, he realizes that the last thing he must do is drag his father into hell with him.\n\r\nWith his renewed purpose, Lelouch quickly sets off to defeat the Emperor, throwing the Britannian ranks into chaos by using his Geass to make numerous soldiers slaves to his will. As the Britannian forces battle one another, Lelouch confronts the Emperor in the Sword of Akasha, sealing the entrance behind him so they will both be trapped for eternity.\nGeass:\r\nLelouch's Geass, given to him by C.C., grants him \"the power of absolute obedience,\" allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact which they will obey without question. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated in this state are written into the minds of the designated targets once the sigil projects from his eye to theirs. Lelouch could initially toggle Geass activation at will, but subsequently loses this control to an affliction known as Geass runaway.\n\nIn the second season, C.C. gives Lelouch a contact lens that blocks his Geass, but indicates that his Geass will eventually grow powerful enough to render it ineffective.\r\nOf all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch's has been explored the most, and also seems to have the most restrictions and side effects of any Geass introduced.\n\r\n* Commands must be issued verbally.\r\n* The victim must make direct eye contact for commands to be issued. The maximum effective distance is 270 meters. Line of sight via a reflective surface is sufficient for the effect to occur.\r\n* Commands may be issued only once to any given individual, but any number of commands may be issued at initial application so long as eye contact is unbroken. Since Jeremiah's Geass Canceller negates all Geass effects, those exposed to it may be commanded once again.\r\n* The victim will not perform any action disallowed by their physical or mental capabilities, though they will try to carry out the command to the best of their ability. For example, a victim will not be able to correctly answer a question they don't know the answer to, but will direct the user to someone who can if they are able. However, commands that affect the mind or consciousness, such as telling the victim to forget something, will take effect despite the fact that the victim could not normally force themselves to do so.\r\n* An action will be carried out for as long as dictated in its command, or upon the indicated conditional circumstance. Eye contact does not need to be maintained for command execution to occur. No upper limit has been established, but the conditional command Lelouch gives Suzaku is still in effect more than a year later.\r\n* The victim's memories for the duration of command issue and execution are sealed and cannot be recalled.\r\n* A victim may resist a commanded action to some degree if it is utterly repugnant to them.\n\r\nSo long as the above conditions are met, commands may be issued to anybody besides those who have gained the power of immortality and to any number of individuals at once. Those under the effect of Geass have a red outline on their pupils, presumably a visual cue for the viewer since the characters never point it out.\n\r\nEven without his Geass, Lelouch is a formidable opponent. He is highly intelligent, possessing a genius-level intellect, and is capable of devising and executing strategies with incredible speed and precision. Rolo notes that operating the Absolute Defense Territory of the Shinkir\u014d requires complex calculations which he cannot perform, while Lelouch almost makes it look easy. In the audio dramas, Suzaku says that, when they were children, Lelouch devised a secret sign language containing over 500 words.\n\r\nLelouch is quick to deduce facts from simple clues. In episode 14, when Mao says C.C.'s name, Lelouch instantly comes up with fourteen different possibilities for Mao's identity, including the correct one. Lelouch is also able to predict the Lancelot's actions exactly through his study of their past battles, allowing Kallen and the Four Holy Swords to almost defeat it (only Suzaku's reflexes saved his life).\n\r\nLelouch is also charismatic and persuasive; as Zero, he is able to win the support of much of Japan's population through well-delivered speeches combined with his ability to make miracles in almost any situation through his superior tactical planning. Mao repeatedly praises Lelouch's persuasive talent, and V.V. remarks that Lelouch is \"a lot like his father.\"\n\r\nPhysically, Lelouch is underwhelming. He possesses the physical prowess of a teenager who engages in little to no strenuous physical activity. Thus, one of Lelouch's traits is the inability to run very fast or for any substantial period of time. Within the series, this is usually played for comedic effect, as Lelouch is constantly outpaced by his classmates in every situation, and even the most simple tasks requiring manual labor exhaust him before he manages to accomplish anything significant. This joke is taken to its logical conclusion in the second season, where it is revealed that Lelouch is supposed to attend remedial physical education classes, but skips them as often as possible. This creates problems when Sayoko poses as Lelouch: she is a master of martial arts, and hence far more athletic than Lelouch himself. Lelouch laments the problem and decides to have Sayoko attend his gym classes to fix it.\n\r\nLelouch is also shown to be very talented at most domestic skills, including cooking and sewing; it has been stated that this comes as a result of his taking care of himself and Nunnally for seven years. He has been shown to be an excellent cook, and is usually the one cooking the food for parties held by the Student Council, both because the others (except Milly) are terrible cooks and nobody else can meet his exacting requirements (such as measuring ingredients to three significant decimals).\n\r\nLelouch also has some skill with firearms, usually brandishing a Britannian pistol when threatening someone. His Knightmare piloting skill has been shown to be proficient but not exceptional; he is a capable pilot by himself, though he tends to be overwhelmed by Suzaku and other pilots with more advanced Knightmares at their disposal. When Lelouch pilots a standard Knightmare on the battlefield, he is typically accompanied by Kallen, who is an elite Knightmare pilot and the leader of his personal squad, Squad Zero.\n\nAfter stealing the Gawain, Lelouch co-pilots it with C.C., controlling the weapons and command functions while C.C. handles navigation and flight. After the Black Knights are exiled from Japan, Lelouch pilots the Shinkir\u014d, which has the most powerful defense of any Knightmare.\n\r\nAt the end of season 2, Lelouch ordered Suzaku to kill him so that his sins and all the people's hatred will disappear and he will be free. Killing him will be a key to future happiness.",

He also smokes constantly in order to keep mushi away.\n\r\nIn terms of personality, Ginko is rather laid back, but can be very serious when it comes to protecting people from mushi. He also often stresses that the mushi are not evil, but they merely exist as a part of the nature and try to survive like every other living being.\n\nWhen Nui found him, he was unconscious in the woods, wounded and abandoned. As he had no place to go, Nui decided to care for him instead of making him leave. He went by the name \"Yoki\" until Nui was consumed by the Ginko mushi. Yoki lost his memory and was forced to take a new name because of the nature of the Ginko mushi, thus changing his name in the only thing he remembers, \"Ginko\"\nGinko's unusual white hair and green eye color is the result of an incident involving a mushi that occurred when he was a child.\nHe lost his other eye and hair color when he tried to save Nui from the Ginko mushi that lived in the pond near where they lived. Nui protected Ginko by telling him to offer them as a sacrifice so the Ginko would let him be. He never saw Nui again and after nearly being consumed by the mushi he adopted the name Ginko to save himself.",

Despite this, she actually does care about others, even if she is embarrassed to admit it. She appears when Kozue is surprised or angered. She is an extreme lightweight, and unable to tolerate anything but umeshu (in the manga), in the anime she can&#039;t even smell liquor without passing out. Her other weakness is fear of butterflies.\n\nNanako Kanazawa\r\nNanako has the personality of a 6 year old. Her hairstyle contains two \"antennae\". She has yellow eyes. She appears when Kozue is embarrassed.She is usually better behaved after she becomes \"Shiny.\" One other noteworthy feature of Nanako is that of all the other personalities that Kozue goes through, Nanako is the only one given an actual age. According to the manga, Saki, Chiyuri, and Natsume all are of unknown age, though it is safe to assume that all of the others have the same age as Kozue.\n\nChiyuri Midorikawa\r\nChiyuri loves cosplay. She also makes everyone else cosplay against their will, but only if it is against their will. If they don&#039;t care or want her to do so, she won&#039;t want to. She appears when Kozue is clumsy or frightened. She wears a large pony tail to the side and has green eyes. While she is in this personality, Tamami acts as her assistant, whom Chiyuri refers to as \"my partner,\" while supplying Tamami many embarrassing photo-ops with which to fill her camera. Tamami, in return, calls Chiyuri \"my sweetheart\". \"Correct!\" is her catch phrase.\n\nNatsume Konno\r\nNatsume has a very shy personality who initially avoided speaking to anyone at all. She is extremely skilled at sleight of hand and card tricks. The first time she talked was when teaching Ryushi one. Flowers will spontaneously pop out of the top of her head (a parody of the first magic trick she shows Ryushi) when she&#039;s happy. Her hairstyle is high pigtails with a layer of hair in the back. She has blue eyes. She has a habit of ending her sentences with \"... kamo,\" meaning either \"maybe\" or \"I think\" depending on the context. She appears when Kozue is saddened.",

    "name": "Eikichi Onizuka",
    "description": "A 22-year-old, hormonal, blonde-haired biker and virgin, Onizuka Eikichi graduated from a bottom-rung university by cheating and, as such, cannot get a decent job. His main way of spending time is peering up girls' skirts in a local mall. He is very athletic, as he can bench press 150 kg (331 lbs), has a second dan black belt in karate, and even claims to perform 500 push-ups, 1000 pull ups and 2000 squats daily.\n\r\nThrough the events explained in the Great Teacher Onizuka manga, Onizuka decides to become a teacher, even though it is later implied that he has an IQ of about 50 (Though not necessarily true). His initial teacher training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki's problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with his students, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead.\n\r\nUnfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers' civil service exam. As a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. He manages to get a job at the upper-crust Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of vice-principal Uchiyamada Hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. Of course, one of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school\u2014in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access\u2014and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Yoshikawa Noboru from committing suicide.\n\r\nOnizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. Not only does he survive the class's brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of Great Teacher Onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own.\n\r\nIt is later implied again, during the National Exams, that Onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. His exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. However, when Yoshito Kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about Onizuka's true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. He checks with Onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach).\n\r\nOnizuka has incredible physical resilience. On more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. Onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character Heihachi from the Tekken series of fighting games, and Jason Voorhees from the films called Friday the 13th (series)). His fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage.\n\r\nIn spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he's acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Kanzaki Urumi kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&M garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Yet another example is when Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that Onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (Onizuka was playing \"where's the nipple\" with his daughter, at a karaoke bar in town).\n\r\nHis personal mode of transportation is a Kawasaki Z2 motorcycle 750cc type S. The bike itself is also featured heavily in the prequel series to GTO.",

Hokuto is vexed by her brother's selflessness, encouraging him to think of himself once in a while, rather than placing the good of others above himself. Although she encourages him to be cheerful and polite, she also criticizes his excessive deference to others, including his habit of bowing to people on the phone \"like a salaryman\". Subaru wears effeminate costumes designed by his sister, her own outfits being even more outlandish.\n\r\nSubaru and Hokuto are good friends with a kindly and magically-aware veterinarian named Seishirou Sakurazuka, who they met at a railway station after Subaru's shikigami led him on a bizarre chase. Seishirou acts as guardian to both and claims to love Subaru romantically. Subaru is frequently embarrassed by these claims, as well as Hokuto's gleeful attempts to bring the two together, but gradually grows to accept the older man's apparent love.\n\r\nDuring Tokyo Babylon, Subaru has dreams of the day he became the head of the Sumeragi clan: he recalls the strange meeting beneath a cherry tree unseasonably in bloom, with a young man who told him the Japanese folk tale that every cherry tree has a corpse buried beneath it, whose blood dyes the white blossoms pink. When the 9-year-old Subaru asked if the buried people were in pain, the young man, initially confused but becoming oddly amused, made a bet with him, the only words of which he heard were: \"If ever we meet again...\" and \"...but today... I will let you go.\" Recalling this dream, Subaru begins to wonder if the sinister young man is actually Seishirou, despite the different personality shown between the two. He also ponders Hokuto's suggestions that Seishirou's surname links him to the Sakurazukamori, a ruthless magical assassin clan, but dismisses it due to Seishirou's kind nature.\n\r\nAfter Seishirou loses the sight in his right eye protecting Subaru, the onmyoji realizes he loves the man. Unfortunately for Subaru, Seishirou reveals that he is indeed the Sakurazukamori, raised to be incapable of either love or hate. Lifting the veil he had placed on the boy's memory, Seishirou states the nature of the bet he had made: that if they met again, he would live with the boy for a year to see if his heart could be moved. However, the assassin claims he was as barren of emotion as ever, and attempts to kill Subaru, only for the boy's grandmother to rescue him at great personal cost. Subaru becomes catatonic as a result, but recovers when, telepathically, he senses Hokuto's self-sacrifice to the Sakurazukamori.\n\r\nSubaru decides at this point to drop out of school so that he can focus on training. He continues his work as an onmyouji, remaining compassionate to others but acting more reserved; he also takes up smoking, like Seishirou before him.\n\nX\r\nBy the time of X/1999, Subaru is his twenties, continuing his work as an onmyouji under direction from his grandmother. Although he is recognized to be one of the Dragons of Heaven, and thus capable of creating a kekkai (spiritual barrier) - star-shaped in his case - to protect others during his battles, he has no interest in the fate of humanity; his only concern is to settle his score with Seishirou. However, with persuasion from Sorata Arisugawa and Arashi Kish\u016b, he joins the other members of the group in Tokyo. One of his first acts is to bring Kamui Shirou out of the catatonia into which he had fallen after seeing his childhood sweetheart, Kotori Monou, killed by her brother F\u016bma. Subaru and Kamui develop a close friendship based on their similar hardships, with Subaru acting as a mentor to Kamui during his further trials. Series creators Clamp, jokingly, refer to Kamui and Subaru's relationship as \"sisterly\".\n\r\nSubaru faces Seishirou several times, but each time, though defeated, is allowed to live; he begin to imagine that the assassin does not consider him \"worth\" killing. When Subaru faces F\u016bma in battle, he sees the younger man as Seishirou, and allows the Dragon of Earth to blind him in his right eye -- a lesser wish Subaru had held for some time. However, in single combat against Seishirou at Rainbow Bridge, Subaru reveals his true desire: he no longer wished to kill Seishirou (having tried unsuccessfully to eradicate his feelings for the man), but instead wished to be killed by him, as thus he would exist in Seishirou's heart, even if it was only as \"another victim of the cherry blossom\". However, due to a spell cast by Hokuto at her death, the killing strike (a \"spearhand\" stab through the heart) is reversed, and Subaru kills Seishirou instead. The assassin's last words to Subaru -- which are not fully stated to the audience -- have a profound effect on the young man, being something he had not expected.\n\r\nFrom this point, the manga and TV series differ. In the manga, following Seishirou's death, Subaru is slated to become the next Sakurazukamori, for the ritual of succession for Sakurazukamori is to kill their predecessor. Seishirou wished for Subaru to erase the mark another man had left on him. As such, Fuma gave Subaru Seishirou's eye, which he states was the only thing of his he could find at Rainbow Bridge, to replace the one the young man lost. This act completes this ritual and, after regaining his full sight, Subaru becomes the Sakurazukamori and one of the Dragons of Earth. Since he has lost the one person he wished to protect, he is rendered unable to create a kekkai any longer. His fate beyond this is unknown as the manga remains incomplete.\n\r\nIn the TV series, his status as Sakurazukamori is not directly alluded to. Instead, Subaru sinks back into a catatonic state, urging Kamui to look to his own wish and advising him that \"it is impossible for everyone to be happy\". He is, as in the manga, unable to create a kekkai, having lost the one person in the world for whom he truly cared. However, in the final episode, the rebellious Dragon of Earth dreamseer Kakyou Kuzuki allows the spirit of Hokuto to cross into Subaru's mind, to convince him to continue the fight; Subaru realizes he cares for Kamui, and joins his final battle against F\u016bma, protecting him from a fatal strike. Before his apparent death, Subaru urges Kamui to realize his wish. Thus, Kamui sacrifices himself to bring F\u016bma back to his original, kind-hearted personality and save humanity from destruction; as a side effect, Subaru is revived and lives on.\n\nTsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle\r\nSubaru reappears as one of a pair of twin vampires (the other being Kamui Shirou) for whom Seishirou Sakurazuka is searching. A correlation is also shown in Subaru's relationship with Seishiro, for he seems worried about him when he asks Fuuma how he is doing in the Tokyo arc. Also, though Kamui appears to have an intense hatred for Seishiro, Subaru is much more lax about their situation of being chased and seems to silently disagree with his twin.\n\r\nHe makes his first appearance in the Tokyo arc, in which he talks to a comatose Sakura and urges her to wake up before she is lost to her dreams. It turns out that he himself was left in a comatose state at the bottom of a large water reservoir, leading to Kamui's fierce protection of the site, particularly from Fuuma. Eventually he wakes and is at last rejoined with his twin.\n\nxxxHolic\r\nIn volume one, Y\u016bko Ichihara mentions knowing an onmyouji with a twin sister whom she has known since the onmyouji was very young. She hopes that the boy will be happy, but there are many definitions for happiness. This onmyouji is Subaru.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "name": "Urumi Kanzaki",
    "description": "Her hatred for teachers stems from her time in elementary school. Urumi's teacher, Ms. Fujimori, while initially welcoming and receptive, wasn't able to handle her intellect properly, since she went to a second-rate college, and it was her first year teaching. Urumi's constant requests for the teacher's time, both inside and outside of school, as well as the fact that the lessons she wanted to learn from the teacher included extremely advanced, college-level subjects (such as differential calculus) eventually made the teacher snap. When Urumi interrupted Ms. Fujimori's lecture to correct her in front of the whole class, the teacher then told Urumi's secret to her class. While it isn't stated explicitly, it can be deduced that her intelligence is derived from her biological father, when Urumi tells Eikichi Onizuka that her mother had selected a sperm-donor, based on his intellect and nothing more. It is even suggested that her mother took the sperm from an American scientific genius (this information can be gleaned from a scene where Urumi and her mother visited some friends in the United States, and Urumi was led into a dark storage room by a doctor, who explains to her that her father is actually just a bottle of donated sperm); this also explains Urumi's natural, blond hair. Naturally, this caused a great deal of psychological trauma to Urumi, and quite an understandable hatred of teachers. It is still unclear what happened to Ms. Fujimori, as her last appearance in the storyline was begging Onizuka to help Urumi before something terrible happens to her.\n\r\nShe is later found by Miyabi in a small apartment, and hired to torture Onizuka. Formerly a student at Holy Forest for a while, but stopped attending regularly after some time, she begins almost immediately, as she frames him for lechery and sends him to jail overnight, only to appear in class and on his homeroom roster the morning after. Onizuka's frustration with her vastly increases, when Vice-Principal Uchiyamada strictly advises him that he cannot inflict physical harm on her due, to her educational potential. Urumi is eventually able to turn Onizuka into her slave (more-or-less, her \"genie\") by threatening to have him arrested, after she fakes her death when he accidentally pushes her off a building.\n\r\nHowever, all this changes when she encounters her Ms. Fujimori again, awakening her deepest hatred and causing her to direct her wrath at the student body. Onizuka responds by bringing his biker gang to school and \"kidnaps\" her from class. He is finally able to get through to her by almost killing the two of them by jumping over - and nearly falling into - a gap at a suspension bridge, despite her attempts to convince him that she is not afraid of anything, including death. Onizuka makes her see past her trauma, however bad, just isn't worth messing up the present with (in the manga, he does this by having his biker friends share their life experiences with her). Inspired, she allies with Onizuka, and helps with his troubles.\n\r\nDespite her switch in allegiance, Urumi continues her feud with Miyabi, until Miyabi reveals her origins to the student body. Urumi retaliates by setting up a web page, where she promises to post pictures of Miyabi in her bathroom (Urumi had earlier placed a hidden camera), after a countdown timer reaches zero. However, the site reveals only a single photograph of Urumi, Miyabi, and Tomoko Nomura during their younger years. Urumi never had any intention of ruining Miyabi; she just wanted to scare her. Urumi attempts suicide at an indoor skiing arena by freezing to death, but Onizuka rescues her. It is after this incident that Urumi considers Onizuka to be her \"favorite.\"\n\r\nShe grows extremely infatuated with Onizuka, to the point of wanting to elope with Onizuka. Urumi takes a more stereotypical role of a character that prefers the use of violence, in response to jealousy - she is often seen beating Onizuka mercilessly every time he tries to fulfill his pervertednes. Urumi states Onizuka should wait for her hormones to start kicking in, because she's sure that she would have a bouncing body by then. Like Noboru Yoshikawa, her loyalty to Onizuka is extremely strong, to the point that she would consider suicide, if he were to leave, believing that her own life is worthless without him around.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "The man who was shot was Revy's father, because she was fed up with her father.\r\nRevy is very competitive, easily bored, and extremely ill-tempered. Unlike Rock, she is undiplomatic, believing in the use of brute force and coercion to get her way. In contrast to this, she's revealed to be highly ticklish.\n\r\nRevy is a merciless and sadistic killer, without a conscience, who will kill anyone at the slightest provocation, even unarmed civilians (as seen in episode 6). Dutch once made reference to University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman in describing Revy after she slaughtered the crew of the Neo-Nazis' boat after a previous conversation with Rock brought up some unpleasant memories, resulting in an internal fit of rage - she even threatened Rock with death if he ever questions or tampers with her way of life. Of all the characters in the series, Revy uses the most foul language. She takes maniacal glee in killing anyone and everyone. She is also a heavy smoker and drinker.\n\r\nShe has a changing but volatile attitude towards Rock; though she respects him later in the series, she is mostly hostile towards him. She shot Rock at point blank range, but he moved her gun at the last second, during a confrontation in episode 7, and in episode 1 emptied most of a magazine in his direction while arguing with Dutch about their hostage. However, she does have a tendency to save Rock from critical situations, and later on she admits to considering Rock as family to Balalaika. It is possible that she has an attraction to Rock, based on her reactions to Eda's teasing, which appear to be jealousy.\n\r\nAccording to CIA agents on Basilan Island, towards the end of episode 12, Revy is still notorious in the NYPD, particularly at the 27th Precinct. Since the 27th Precinct does not exist in real-life New York City, this throwaway reference may - or may not - indicate an odd connection to Dick Wolf's Law and Order franchise. This is further suggested in a later episode, when Revy specifically mentions the series.\n\r\nRevy is one of the deadliest fighters in the series, whose skill with firearms and ability to dodge bullets is almost superhuman and unparallelel. There are only a few other characters, such as Roberta and Ginji, that can hold their ground against her in combat.\n\r\nHer weapons of choice are a pair of modified Beretta 92FS's; which are made out of stainless steel and had their barrels extended from 4.9\" to 5.9\" each (the 5.9\" is the combat MOD barrel) and also adapted for silencers. They are engraved with \"9mm Sword Cutlass\" on both sides, as well as the Jolly Roger of the infamous pirate Calico Jack (which is also inlaid into the ivory grips), and a manufacture inscription in Thai. Due to her ambidextrous marksmanship skills, she is nicknamed \"Two Hand\" by the denizens of Roanapur. However, Revy has been seen using a variety of other firearms.\n\r\nConstantly living on the edge of life, Revy has developed a rather bleak, almost nihilistic outlook on life, relying only on her own power, skills, and money. She does not believe in God or emotions. However, she seems to respect and trust her companions.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "Within the Lagoon Company, Rock is usually responsible for account management, diplomacy, negotiation, interpretation, and the occasional errand. Having once worked in the resource investigation department of Asahi Industries, Rock is also skilled in geology. He is also a skilled linguist, being effectively bilingual in Japanese (his native language) and English as well as being familiar with other languages, including Spanish, Romanian and Russian. He also has a surprisingly high tolerance for alcohol, owing to the heavy-drinking lifestyle of a ladder-climbing salaryman. Rock's earnest personality has earned him the interest of several figures in Roanapur, including Balalaika, Mr. Chang, Rowan \"Jackpot\" Pigeon, Yolanda, Eda (who develops a crush on him), and young Garcia Lovelace, whom he trusts to the greatest degree. In many ways, Rock is the heart of the Lagoon Company, serving as a balance for his more jaded teammates and as a bright spot in the world of darkness that is Roanapur. Dutch has stated that he believes Lagoon Company is complete with Rock not holding a gun, saying his bullets are the kind to ricochet back at them.\n\r\nRock is one of the \"luckiest\" characters in the series as he managed to survive every single thing he experienced from being taken hostage to being shot at. Thus far, he has survived the wrath of Revy, Balalaika, Roberta, and Sawyer. He is personally appointed by Mr. Chang to help Garcia Lovelace, much to Lagoon Company's disapproval. Rock eventually begins to enjoy his life as a pirate and becomes even more comfortable with corruption. Later, in a conversation with Fabiola, he demonstrates a darker, sadistically ruthless side of his personality clearly influenced by Revy and the Roanapur environment. Benny even points out that there are things about him that scare almost everyone in Roanapur.\n\r\nWhile Rock has a family in Tokyo, he does not seem to have much connection to them due to their somewhat apathetic attitude towards him. It was later revealed that he did not pass his college entrance exams on his first try, leading his family to lower their expectations of him. It is known that he has a father, a mother, and an older brother who was academically capable and thus attained a job in the Japanese government. He was born in the 49th year of the Showa period, according to the manga version, which corresponds to 1975-1976.",

    "description": "Balalaika can be easily identified by the burn marks which scar most of the right side of her face, neck, and chest which she suffered in Afghanistan, earning her the nickname \"Fry-Face\" by those who dislike her. She has long blonde hair, and usually wears a military greatcoat, thrown over a low-cut business suit. She smokes cigars, in contrast with the other characters who smoke cigarettes. Based on her service in Afghanistan and the missed opportunity to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, she is between 31\u201335 years old. She is one of the few people to earn Revy's respect. In turn, Balalaika also seems to hold Rock in high regard, sometimes relying on his knowledge and business skills.\n\r\nIn critical operations, Balalaika calls upon a personal cadre of ex-Soviet airborne troops and Spetsnaz commandos who are Afghanistan veterans. Known as the Desantniki, they act as Hotel Moscow's special ops team. When conducting foreign operations from Thai soil, she uses the Russian cargo ship Maria Zeleska as a legal cover from the police and various law enforcement agencies. In spite of the fact that Balalaika is on the Interpol list, she uses the pseudonym Vladilena N. Vasilinov in Japan, being covered by diplomatic immunity.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited)",

Similar to L's fondness for sweets, Mello is often seen eating bars of chocolate.

Tsugumi Ohba, the writer of Death Note, stated that Mello \"works hard for everything.\" Ohba added that Mello's name \"doesn't really stand for anything,\" as opposed to Near's name standing for Nate River, etc.\n\r\nMello is voiced by Nozomu Sasaki in the Japanese anime,  David Hurtwitz in the English version and Javier Olgu\u00edn in the Latin Spanish dub.\n\nMello decides to find Kira his own way by joining the Mafia.

After learning that Light is Kira and Near was going to attempt to apprehend him, Mello kidnaps Kiyomi Takada, but is soon killed by Takada's hidden pages of the Death Note. This action causes Teru Mikami to expose his own Death Note to kill Takada, an action that Near picks up on and is eventually able to use to thwart Light's plans. Near reflects this during the final showdown and credits Mello as the single most pivotal person in discovering Light's plans. Hal Lidner further believes that it was Mello's plan that he would be killed to expose Light's plan, but Near rejects this theory.\r\nHis date of death is January 26th, 2010.

Rather than needing to acquire blood from humans, her body produces too much blood instead (polycythemia). To make matters worse, her blood levels increase dramatically whenever she senses unhappiness in those around her, or if she gets embarrassed about something. This results in frequent nosebleeds, followed by anemic symptoms such as light-headedness, which causes frequent visits to the school nurses office so she can rest. She does not suck blood from her \"victims\"; rather, she injects her surplus into them instead. This has the effect of making her victims very lively and positive.\n\r\nManga:\nAt one point Karin is rendered unconscious for several days after trying to hold in her blood and suffering a massive nosebleed, during which time her family grows increasingly concerned that her condition would kill her. Her mother journeys to her birthplace in search of answers and learns that Karin is a rare vampire, called the \"Spring of Psyche\", that is born when the vampire species is struggling. The blood Karin produces can bestow fertility in other vampires. Karin is later kidnapped by vampires who want to feed from her to rejuvenate their own lives, though it will kill Karin in the process. They also plan to impregnate Karin against her will to continue the Psyche's existence. After Kenta and the Marker family save Karin from the Brownlicks, her nose-bleeding ceases, leaving her as though she were a normal human, who will likely grow old and die. Her family erases all of her memories of vampires, including themselves, promising Kenta that they will continue watching over her happiness although she will not know them. At the end of the series, Karin and Kenta have married and are shown to have a teenage daughter named Kanon.\n\r\nAnime:\nIn the anime adaptation, the blood-making issue and Karin's capture are not mentioned. Instead, Karin has the opportunity to become a full vampire, which she initially declines, but then pursues after Kenta encourages her. The transformation is interrupted and Karin goes berserk. Kenta comes to her rescue by volunteering to be bitten, ending the berserker rage, confirming their romantic relationship. at the end of the anime she is still \"un-vampire\", is still dealing with her blood-making issue, still has of all her memories and still lives with her family and spend lots of time with Kenta.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, Chibi Vampire Wikia)",

However, he prefers female victims, seducing female victims and often spending days in their company before he's done with them, and refuses to suck on male blood. \n\r\nRen sees the act of biting as a metaphor for sexual intercourse, and often commits both acts simultaneously. Ren often appears annoyed at Karin for her seeming lack of vampiric abilities and her friendliness towards humans. While he will listen to his father Henry, Anju is often the one who will calm him when he's annoyed or subtly prod him into acting in certain ways. He greatly fears Elda, whose overly affectionate manner when he was a child causes him to flee at the mere sight or mention of her.",

Kyou was born in the Mibu village and was friends with the former Aka no Ou. Once the Aka no Ou turned evil, Muramasa took Kyou from the village so that he may grow up to be the 'hope' of the Mibu clan. Kyou travelled the world and formed the Shiseiten in order to become strong enough to return to the Mibu village and defeat the former Aka no Ou.

Yukimura can utilize the Sekireigan to access extreme speed, but Anri instructed him to never use it more than five times a day.\n\nWhen he was young, his childhood girlfriend was killed in a massacre that could have been avoided, but was not for strategic reasons. He seems to have greatly admired the Toyotomi clan's founder, Hideyoshi, when he talked about his past, and the reason to his other given name Toyotomi Nobushige.\n\nIn volume 26, he fights and defeats Shindara. He also fights Kyo to a draw in volume 27, both of them using their most powerful techniques, however Kyo is not in his true body, nor has he awakened his true red eyes. Yukimura shows big progress throughout the story, but most of it occurs off the page, with Yukimura simply leaving the main party and returning a stronger warrior. He trains with Anri, one of Muramasa's guards, who teaches him the Sekireigan. With this he is able to move extremely fast and attack from many angles simultaneously. He later faces both Chinmei and the Former Crimson King himself, though he loses to the King, he is able to defeat Chinmei with the help of Sasuke and the Juuyuushi. Although he is not on Kyo nor Kyoshiro's level at the end, he is clearly as strong as the Four Emperors.\n\nYukimura is renowned for his casual, cheerful demeanour; he is almost always seen with a smile and often seems very preoccupied with seducing beautiful women and drinking sake. He is thirty-seven years old, and attributes his youthful appearance to good skin care. Despite this, he can be terrifying when he is enraged. He is also notable for his treatment of his ninja followers, whom he cares about and respects deeply as members of his family. As a result, the Juuyuushi are not only loyal to him, but care about him personally.\n\nYukimura hates Ieyasu more than anything. It is interesting to note that historically, Yukimura had already fought Ieyasu's son, Hidetada (Benitora), at the battle of Ueda Castle. This is briefly mentioned in the anime and possibly the manga. It is a battle which is believed to have ended in Yukimura's loss.",

The Shibien blade, however, is exceptionally bloodthirsty and its creator, Muramasa, had to have it bound in chains to prevent it from turning on anyone. Strangely enough, it serves Sasuke obediently. Sasuke seems to have control over Lightning techniques. Sasuke possesses a technique called Raikoken that electrifies his sword. Thunder Fire calls a bolt of lightning down to strike an enemy. Thunder Flower Storm brings many lightning bolts down around Sasuke and his enemy. Thunder Net traps Sasuke's enemies in a web of lightning which never lets go. Thunder Tail connects Sasuke's lightning to his sword allowing him to kill an enemy with a physical strike. Sasuke's ultimate technique is Kirin which creates a lightning winged Pegasus that burns all it touches when it returns to heaven.\n\nAlso, it was seen in several of Sasuke's battles that he has the same red eyes as Kyo.",

    "name": "Shirou Emiya",
    "description": "Affiliation: Homurahara Academy, Year 2 class C\r\nHeight: 167 cm\r\nWeight: 58 kg\r\nServant: Saber\r\nLikes: housework\r\nDislikes: Umekobucha \r\nTalents: tinkering with junk, housework\r\nFamous quote: \"I don't want to regret anything. I want to make all the tragedies that happened into meaningful things by believing that my path is right.\"\n\r\nShirou is the main character of Fate/stay night. He is a serious yet helpful, hardworking, and honest teenager. His hobbies include fixing a variety of broken things, from VCRs to stoves, as well as cooking and cleaning. He has some slight talent with sorcery, though he was discouraged by his foster father Kiritsugu Emiya from improving his gifts. He is initially confused about the Holy Grail War and attempts to irrationally shield others from danger, including his own Servant, Saber.\n\r\nShirou is unskilled in most traditional forms of sorcery, and his only effective magic is Reinforcement, the power to analyze the structural composition of objects and increase their effectiveness by understanding their chemical and physical makeup, such as the sharpness and durability of a sword and shield. However, he lacks mastery for even this simple spell, and his various applications of it are limited.\n\nWhile Shirou is struggling to learn Reinforcement, the first magic he learned is Projection, which is a much less effective magic compared to Reinforcement. However, Shirou's projection (referred as Tracing) is fundamentally different from normal projection. While initially it proves to be an useless skill due to the fact that Shirou can only produce hollow objects, the projected item can remain in the world for a long time. Later on, due to Shirou's Sword Affinity, he is able to copy the history and special properties of bladed items, even noble phantasms, though they are of slightly lesser quality (They are downgraded one rank from the original). At the culmination of his abilities is his Reality Marble, Unlimited Blade Works, which is the source of his unusual projection magic, Projection and Reinforcements are simply by-products of it. Unlike the normal projection which simply shapes an item out of prana, Shirou's projection summons the item from inside Unlimited Blade Works without expanding the reality marble. When expanded, Unlimited Blade Works manifests itself as a barren wasteland covered in swords, but with a beautiful dawn in the sky. In there exist all of the materials Shirou needs to recreate any bladed weapon, and Shirou is able to control all of the swords in Unlimited Blade Works using only his mind, using them to attack his opponent without having to physically touch them.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "name": "Saber ",
    "description": "Weight: 42 kg\r\nThree sizes: B73-W53-H76\r\nBlood type: O\r\nArmaments: armor, sword\r\nLikes: well-structured meals, stuffed animals\r\nDislikes: badly structured meals, dressing up too much\r\nTalents: gymnastic exercise, secretly good in all kinds of gambling\r\nFamous quote: \"There are no regrets. If one can be proud of one's life, one should not wish for another chance.\"\n\nFate/stay night\nShe is Shirou's Servant, an agile but powerful warrior. Loyal, independent, and reserved, Saber acts coldly but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. Her class is considered the \"Most Outstanding,\" with excellent ratings in all categories. Since her Master cannot effectively provide her with mana, she minimizes her activity to preserve what she has. Saber is frustrated by Shirou's \"protective\" tendencies, believing his erratic and reckless behavior will jeopardize her chances of winning the Holy Grail War.\n\r\nSaber is a strong-willed young woman who always speaks resolutely. She is courageous, determined, and set on winning the Holy Grail. She constantly insists that she is a knight first and that her gender is of little importance to her. She is resolute in following her own morals regardless of more viable tactics being available should she consider them to be underhanded, leading to conflicts with Kiritsugu over the strategy within the Fourth Holy Grail War. While obtaining the Holy Grail is of the utmost importance, rejecting her chivalry is something that she will not do under normal circumstance even if it should put her at a disadvantage.\n\r\nShe doesn't like to be treated as a woman, or even as a human, due to her status as a knight and a Servant. She tries to keep the notion that she is only a Servant, a tool for her Master, first and foremost in her mind, so she initially has no objections about Shirou accidentally seeing her naked body. She slowly becomes more aware of herself after their relationship develops, and eventually even becomes flustered upon the same situation being repeated. She is unwilling to show emotions, as she has suppressed them so strongly and views herself as a knight foremost. Even though she attempts to hide them, her insecurities become more and more apparent, and she later begins to open up more and show her emotions more easily, especially to Shirou.\n\r\nThough she once felt more linked to dragons, she came to enjoy lions after taking care of a lion cub for a month at some point in her life. She claims that it is not that she \"likes\" them, but rather the happiness she experienced as he became attached to her brought forth a bond with them. He was very energetic, often biting or scratching, but she wished to be able to stay with him until the end. She has had feelings for them since then, and even remembers the fond memories while holding a stuffed lion. Shirou seeing the memory of her rubbing her cheek against the lion comments on it being a time where she looks like a girl her age.\n\r\nShe is shown to have a humongous appetite, finishing large servings of rice within one minute. Although she can normally eat anything, Shirou's food education is what awoke her gourmet spirit. She originally did not appreciate modern food as she doesn't actually need to eat as a Servant and because she had believed that all food was like fish and chips. She had very bad experiences with the food in her time, due being limited to meals like large quantities of potatoes, vinegar, bread, and ale or even at times simply eating vegetables alone.\n\r\nShe did not concern herself with food much in her life, allowing the cooks to do as they wished. She felt it was unrefined, although she was not displeased by it. She does shudder at the thought of eating it compared to Shirou's cooking. She thought it had been made to suit the tastes of the knights because they acknowledged it as tasting good, but they simply were unable to say it was bad to the King's face.\n\r\nShe is very cold and merciless to Illya during most of Fate/stay night despite her being Irisviel's daughter. This is due to the fact that she never asked Irisviel about the name of her daughter, and when Saber sees Illya during the war, she completely disregards the possibility that it could be the same child. She believes that Illya is too young to be the girl she saw getting a piggy-back ride ten years before, and she believes that she would have become more mature like her mother by the time of the Fifth Holy Grail War. She reasons that Illya is a new homunculus completely unrelated to Irisviel with similarities in her appearance due to the Einzbern homunculi looking alike after their creation. Given a chance to casually interact with her, while she doesn't trust Illya at first, she is eventually able to act nicely around her. She is able to freely have fun around her without any worries.\nFate/Zero\nSaber is summoned by Kiritsugu Emiya to participate in the Fourth Holy Grail War on behalf of Jubstacheit von Einzbern and the Einzbern family. Kiritsugu partners Saber with Irisviel von Einzbern, to act as Saber's Master in the open while he acts from behind to win with his own methods. On the final day of the Holy Grail war, Saber found the Holy Grail but she also meets Gilgamesh who was waiting for her. He proposes that she becomes his wife while she lays defeated in front of him. Saber refuses as the Holy Grail is just in front of her. Saber destroyed the Holy Grail in the fourth Holy Grail War because Kiritsugu used multiple command seals in order to force her to act against her will. However, she only managed to destroy the Grail's physical form. She was also caught in her own Excalibur blast, sending her back to the battlefield of Camlann. She was the sixth and final servant to perish in the fourth Holy Grail War.\nHer true identity is that of King Arthur aka. Arthur Pendragon (Uther's daughter who hid her gender to be accepted as King). She has joined the Holy Grail War in order to grant her wish of redoing the selection of King due to her belief that she failed to keep her country from chaos. She wields the legendary holy sword Excalibur (cloaked in a veil of wind to hide its popular identity and thus its owner's) but no longer carries its lost sheath Avalon.\r\n(Source: Type Moon Wiki, Wikipedia)",

That's something I've had since I was born. If you tell me to rule such a world, I already rule it.\"\n\r\nRin is a model student and idol of Shirou's school. She barely talks to other students in her school and exhibits a desire to be left alone as exemplified by her tendency to stay on the school's rooftop, away from the rest of the students. She is secretly a Magus and a Master in the Fifth Holy Grail War. In the beginning of the anime, she summons Archer for her Servant, although she originally wanted to summon Saber. Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father Tokiomi Toosaka to prioritize sorcery over her own interests.\n\r\nTwo centuries ago, the Toosaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Toosaka; at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and future wars. Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch; these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's Association and the Church, allowing the Toosaka family to participate in the Holy Grail Wars, free from harassment by either organization.\n\r\nRin was brought up as the successor to her family's magecraft, and was instructed by her father to prioritize magecraft over her own interests. Ten years ago, Tokiomi Toosaka was selected as a Master in the 4th Holy Grail War, and Rin was entrusted to take care of the Toosaka estate until his return. Her mother, Aoi Toosaka, was left in a debilitated state from the war, so her care was left to her guardian, Kirei Kotomine. After her father was killed, Rin continued to improve her sorcery with some guidance from Kirei Kotomine. To divert attention from her private life, Rin has diligently strived to earn the admiration of her peers, even though she is secretly stingy, tomboyish, and a slacker.\n\r\nThe rights to the Toosaka lands were inherited by Aoi after Tokiomi's death, and subsequently inherited by Rin after Aoi's death. Kirei managed them as Rin's guardian, and because of his foolhardy and coarse management, the majority of profitable properties ended up in the hands of others. It is possible that he believed the wealth was bad for her upbringing due to following the principles of humility and poverty.\n\r\nAlthough Rin resents the sacrifices she has endured for the sake of tradition, she is fiercely competitive and eager to prove herself as a skilled and capable magus. She was immensely disappointed at summoning Archer and ended up in a quarrel with him; however, the duo soon reconciled, set aside their differences and quickly got along.\n\nFor the sake of her deceased father and her family's name, Rin seeks to obtain the Holy Grail, though she has little personal desire for it. Unbeknownst to her sister Sakura, Rin feels guilty and believes that she has abandoned Sakura after she is adopted into the Matou household, so much the guilt was what driven her to revive Shirou, Sakura's target of affection, at the brink of death.\n\r\nRin seems to exhibit this in regards to Sakura. For someone who is usually very intelligent and observant, she is remarkably poor at noticing all of the things that have changed about her sister, including even her hair color. When she goes into the Matou house for the first time, she immediately realizes what being the Matou heir means, and yet despite knowing that Shinji has no potential as a magus, and that her sister was adopted into that family because her father couldn't train both of them, she fails to make the obvious logical jump to figuring out Rider's true Master or her sister's situation until it is explicitly pointed out to her. Of course, since working it out would have meant either hand-waving the fact that her sister is suffering horrific torture, or breaking from her duty as guardian of Fuyuki in an effort to save her, it's perhaps understandable that she decided not to think too hard about it.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nNote: \"Rin Toosaka\" is the correct spelling of this name per Hepburn romanization, which is used as a MyAnimeList standard. Please do not submit changes for the name.",

It's not because of your Magic Circuit or your talent, but because your mind is pure... I knew that from the first time I met you. I knew you would never betray anyone.\"\n\r\nA student in her first year of high school, Sakura is the sister of Shinji Mato. After Shirou's father Kiritsugu died, Sakura often visited Shirou's home to help him with his daily chores. She is outwardly shy and timid, but possesses great inner strength. Sakura has a long standing and obvious crush on Shirou Emiya.\n\nSakura is the biological sister of Rin Toosaka, and has been in the care of the Matou family for many years. Like most sorcerers, her father, Tokiomi Toosaka, only chose one daughter to carry on his family's tradition believing that raising an additional child would introduce competition. Zouken Matou, an ancient ally of the Toosaka House, offered to adopt Sakura, for his own heir, Shinji Matou, who was incapable of sorcery.\n\r\nIn Fate/Zero, it is revealed that Kariya Matou, now Sakura's uncle, made a deal with Zouken Matou to win the Holy Grail in exchange for her freedom from Zouken and to be able to return to the Toosaka family. Kariya was the only member of the Matou family to love Sakura; since Kariya was a childhood friend of Aoi Toosaka (Sakura's mother), he had become well-acquainted with Sakura and her sister. He was in love with Aoi, but gave up peacefully because she seemed to be happy accepting her engagement to Tokiomi. Since he never received training as a magus (though he had more potential in comparison to Shinji's father Byakuya Matou), he has worms implanted in him to boost his circuits, and underwent accelerated training for the coming war. The worms shortened his life span and constantly weakened body since they are eating away at his magical circuits. Considering his ever weakening body and the large mana requirement required for nature of his servant, a Berserker, it is not terribly surprising that Kariya loses the 4th Grail War, possibly at the hands of his own servant.\n\r\nUnder Matou care, Sakura is subjugated to physical and mental abuse on a daily basis. Zouken seeks to use her as one of his future vessels, empowered by the power of Angra Mainyu. Gathering the tainted fragments of the shattered grail from the last war, Zouken hybridizes the collected black ichor with several of his worm familiars. He implants these parasitic worms into Sakura's body; they drain her Mana. Sakura's plum hair and eye color are direct consequences of Zouken's worms swimming through her bloodstream.\n\r\nAlthough castigated and humiliated on a daily basis, Sakura maintains her bearings with great stoicism. She fell in love with Shirou Emiya several years ago after secretly watching him constantly attempt to jump a bar (as a track-and-field practice). His staying dedication inspires Sakura to endure her hardships, and her admiration gave her the confidence to approach and assist Shirou after he receives an injury. Shirou's growing relationship with Rin is a source of hatred and envy for Sakura, for she believes Rin to be the cause of all her torture. For the eleven years after her adoption, Sakura grew to resent Zouken for his cruelty, her father for sending her away, and finally Rin, who was unaware of her sister's suffering, for never coming to save her.\n\r\nSakura is the principal Master of Rider, who was summoned several days prior to the start of the 5th Holy Grail War. However, under pressure from Shinji and the desire not to fight either Shirou or Rin, Sakura yielded her Master's right to him, although Sakura retains her original Command Mantra.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Her weapon of choice is a pair of long iron nails fastened to opposite ends of a single chain, which she effectively thrusts from distances.\n\nRider was actually summoned by Sakura. Due to Sakura's unwillingness to participate as a Master, Shinji Matou is instead given control over Rider.\nRider's identity is Medusa, the Gorgon from Greek mythology. Rather than being a regular Heroic Spirit, she is an existence closer to a Divine Spirit, but her actions have made it better to categorize her as an \"anti-hero closer to a monster.\" With her older sisters Stheno and Euryale, they made up the three Gorgon Sisters who inhabited the Shapeless Isle. She was known as the \"woman who dominates,\" an anti-hero who became as such due to the dark thoughts of humans. Differing from someone like Hassan-i-Sabbah who was a hero who actual existed, she is said to be one of legends born by the gathering of belief.\n\r\nThe legend of Medusa is different than her actual life. She was said to be a half-human, half-god female beast often portrayed with the form of a snake. Originally she was an Earth Goddess. While all originally beautiful women, she and her sisters were hated by Poseidon's wife because of his love for them. Athena, jealous of their beautiful hair, transformed them into demons. Secluding themselves in a lightless temple on the Shapeless Isle, they only attacked humans with a reason. Eventually, as a victim of the gods' unreasonable actions, she was to have her head cut off on their whim. Defeated by Perseus by reflecting her petrification back at her with his mirror-like shield, Pegasus, the son of Poseidon, was said to have sprung from the blood of her headless neck. \nIn her backstory, She was teased by her sisters for being mortal unlike them, and because Athena sent her followers to attack them, she turned into a man-eating monster that devoured them. At the time of her death, she reminisced that they did actually love one another and accepted she misses her time with them. One of the reasons she is so sympathetic to Sakura is because she is so broken too.",

Without knowing it.\n\r\nThroughout the entire second season, she and Lantis are brought together many times, by circumstances, and it is not until Nova points out that she is very much in love with Lantis that Hikaru realizes it herself.\n\r\nAfter a grueling battle, in her own mind, to reforge the sword that Nova managed to break, Hikaru comes out victorious and, on the verge of blacking out in Lantis's arms, confesses to him that she loves him. She does not remember it after she wakes up but the feelings are still alive in her heart and Nova takes advantage of them time and time again.\n\r\nDespite the animosity between Cephiro and the three invading countries, she manages to befriend Eagle Vision of Autozam, making Eagle a sort of bridge between both his friends.\n\r\nAt one point in the anime, Eagle and Hikaru both become candidates for the Pillar position but it is Hikaru who is chosen in the end and makes a wish to rid Cephiro of its oppressive system; wishing for Cephiro to be created by all those who love it.\n\r\nIn the manga, Hikaru's feeling for Lantis is less mature and she likes both Lantis and Eagle Vision. When Lantis asked her in final chapter who she wants to marry, she answered, that she wants to marry him and Eagle. Also bond between Hikaru and Eagle Vision is stronger in manga, because in manga she fought with him for the position of the Pillar, defeated him and then saved his life against the will of the Creator.\n\r\n(Source: Magic Knight Wikia)",

Fuu loses it when the three go home to Tokyo in the first series, but in the second series, when they return, he gives it to her for a second time.) Since he has one identical to it, he uses it to communicate with her throughout the first series. \n\r\nIn the anime's first season, Ferio once pretended to join Ascot, Lord Zagato's child summoner, who set a trap for the Magic Knights using his sound-sensitive monster, Pajero. Also, while the Magic Knights are facing Inouva's true form, Ferio regains his memory from his younger years. He realizes that he was Princess Emeraude's only younger brother, and hears his sister's voice coming from his own orb, telling him how to defeat Inouva. Ferio relays the info to the Knights and they manage to kill their enemy. \n\r\nIn the OVA, he is initially a villain who can summon and control swarms of insects. He appears to have a close relationship with Ascot, and in a twist of his original character, he is the villain who does battle with Fuu. After eavesdropping on Lantis' conversation with Hikaru and the others, he assists Lantis in fighting Cephiro's spirits, and later delivers Lantis' sword to the combined Mashin to help them fight Eagle. \n\r\nFerio gets his name from the Honda Civic Ferio, and Ascot's monster from the episode featuring Ferio is named after the Mitsubishi Pajero. \n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Her trap captures the Magic Knights by mistake, so she ponders whether to stretch their cheeks or boil them in a big pot, again wearing a feathered headdress and doing a war dance. In the anime series, she is killed by one of Ascot's beast summons. This death happens only in the Anime, and created a rather large plot hole.\n\r\nIn the the anime version of the second series, her twin sister, Sierra, to correct this plot hole, poses as her. The only ones to realize that Sierra is not Presea are Clef, Mokona and Alcyone, who recognizes Sierra's deception as stemming partly from her love for Clef. When Clef confronts Sierra about why she is posing as her sister, Sierra replies that it is to help the Knights with their mission and continue her sister's legacy, but doesn't reveal her own feelings for him.\n\r\nPresea's favorite food is listed as V-tek, a kind of candy from Cephiro (though she enjoys the candy from Earth that Hikaru gave her almost as much).\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She intends to wipe the Sea of Corruption off the face of the earth, by any means necessary.  While she is not presented as completely evil, she is definitely an antagonist.\n\r\nIn the manga, she has a much more complicated role, more of an antihero/ally than an antagonist.  She is mostly driven by a desire for revenge against her father and three older half-brothers, whom she hates and blames for the fate of her mother.  She commands the Torumekian Third Army, whom she trained personally; she is devoted to her men, and they are unswervingly loyal to her.  Despite her ferocity in battle, she has a nobility of character that earns her the respect of both Nausica\u00e4 and Master Yupa.  While she admires Nausica\u00e4's pacifist ideals, she sees herself as inescapably destined to walk the path of bloodshed.",

Before the Britannia Empire conquered Area 11, Kallen's original name was Karen Kouzuki. She comes from a prestigious family and attends the Ashford Academy where she receives outstanding grades while serving as a member of its Student Council. When away from the Academy, she fights as an anti-Britannian operative. Also, Kallen helped organize the Black Knights.\n\r\nHer brother, Naoto Kouzuki, with whom she had a deep connection, was a former leader of her resistance cell before his death.\n\r\nBoth Kallen's stepmother, a Britannian, and biological mother live with her in the same house, but her biological mother is employed as a maid and is often mistreated by both her stepmother and Kallen herself. After her biological mother is arrested for using Refrain (a fictional drug which lets people think they're reliving the past), Kallen changes her views and decides to fight against the Britannian Empire not only for her brother, but to fulfill her new wish for a world in which she can live happily with her biological mother.\n\r\nFrail and meek, this aspect of Kallen's character was used as a public front to mask her true nature as well as hide her involvement in the resistance.\n\r\nKallen leads a double life as a normal Britannian student and as a member of a guerrilla resistance group against Britannia, which is later reformed into the Order of the Black Knights by Lelouch Lamperouge. In school, she portrays herself as a weak-bodied high school student who obeys all of the formalities, and goes by her Britannian name of Stadtfeld. However, her personality changes in to a very strong-willed and forceful one when she acts as a resistance fighter.\n\r\nAs a running gag, Kallen ends up nude or immodestly dressed in front of other people on numerous occasions: Lelouch sees her naked after she pulls back a shower curtain in surprise in the third episode, Suzaku sees her bathing under a waterfall when they are stranded on Kaminejima, she is forced to dress in an immodest bunny costume at the start of the second season (to plant a tracking device on Lelouch), and she walks in on a meeting between C.C. and the Chinese ambassadors wearing only a towel when intending to complain about the previous situation to C.C. (claiming that the operation would've gone faster if C.C. was wearing the outfit).\n\r\nIn an interview reported by the anime magazine Newtype USA, seiyu Ami Koshimizu talked about the difficulty of voicing Kallen because of the double life that her character leads. Certain aspects of Kallen's character such as her girlish naivete and competitiveness made it easy for the voice actress to relate, even to the point of admitting that in some ways they act very much the same.",

He agrees with Zero (Lelouch in disguise, unknown to Suzaku) with his assertion that the Britannia Empire is not worth serving, but nevertheless wishes to implement changes and improvements from within the empire, all the while trying not to lose sight of his goals lest his father's death have been in vain. He has a strong sense of justice and is the only one known to be able to pilot the elite Britannian Knightmare Frame, Lancelot. He always keeps with him a broken pocket watch, a memento of his deceased father.\n\nHe is in love with Euphemia and is devastated upon her death. He swears revenge against Zero, for killing her.\n\r\nIn the last episode of R2, Lelouch asks Suzaku to kill him (as all of the world's hatred is now focused upon him) and to become Zero. Suzaku kills Lelouch in front of all the Black Knights and Nunnally at a parade held for Lelouch. After Lelouch dies, Suzaku takes care of Nunnally as Zero and leads the Black Knights.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Back when Train was the XIII Chrono Number and Creed was an eraser, he admired him to the point of calling him \"his partner\", even though their relationship was far from close. Creed captured Rinslet to make Train meet with him at Lunafort Tower, in their first encounter after many years; he wants him to join the Apostles Of The Stars. Creed has a choker that looks like Train's, which reflects his recent and disturbing obsession with him. He borders on the insane, but Creed is at his most disturbing at times when we know what he says must be the truth. \n\nWhen Creed was young, he was abused by his mother. When he found a chance he ran away. There he is abused by police as a way for them to release tension. After this happened he learned he should change the world cause the world as he was a child was reckless and full of \"unworthy people.\" \nHeavy SpoilerCreed also possesses enigmatic and frightening powers that stem from his manipulation of Chi through Tao, which manifest themselves in his 'Imagine Blade, which was originally called the Kotetsu', which varies between four levels through the story (Lv. 1, the blue transparent balde, Lv.2, the black blade with the shark-shaped demon-head, Lv.3,the form where it's not exactly a blade, but a giant cutting mutant arm implanted into Creed , and Lv. Max, the strongest form where the arm creates a light blade similar to a lightsaber). His ultimate ambition is to elevate his nanomachines in his body to a level where he would become immortal and rule the world forever. Creed's Tao Power is called \"Sword\". His Imagine Blade is shattered by Train in his final battle (When it is in Level Max), when Train ignores all warnings from Dr. Tearju not to use his Rail Gun more than three times a day not to destabilize his electric power (Which would prevent him from using his Rail Gun ability ever again), and charges all his power in Hades to fire the most powerful bolt of electricity he could, which not just breaks Creed's blade, but also depletes most of his Ki, allowing him to barely stand. Eve then uses her powers to remove the immortality nanomachines from Creed, to turn him back into a human. Creed then flees with Echidna to a quiet place. Due to the damage taken, Creed eventually has to use a wheelchair. \n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Later, he sees that Durham is killed after he is taken down by Train. He leaves the Apostles of the Stars, together with Kyoko, over an ideological split with Creed, as he considers Creed's bloodlust is blinding his original sense of justice that formed the Apostles of the Stars, but continues to battle Chronos. He meets Train and Sven later in the plot. In the last chapter of the series Charden is seen coughing up blood, implying that he is dying. Charden's Tao Power is called \"Blood\".\n\n\nCharden Flamberge in the Anime\n\nSame as in the manga, except the battle against Belze does not take place, and his leaving of the Apostles takes place at a different time. He makes a reappearance near the end of the anime, though his trademark sunglasses and silk top hat are no longer worn as well as him keeping his hair tied back. He decides to aid Train and the group in the cause of stopping Eden, by fighting the Zero numbers at the end, while Train and Sven head for the upper levels to save Eve also when he tries to talk to Sephiria there is a flash back of them fighting but there battle it self is not shown.\n\nSource: Wikipedia",

At school, Uryuu wears the school uniform along with a tie, while outside he dons white Quincy clothes with blue stripes representing the Quincy cross, and a mantle.\n\r\nUryuu is generally shy and quiet, but tries harder to act cool when other people are around. For example, during the Soul Society arc he wears a mantle that serves no purpose other than to make him look cooler, despite the fact that it hinders his movement. He even keeps a spare to that effect. In addition, he also has a tendency to say things with characteristic drama.\r\nUryuu operates on a moral ethic known as the \"Pride of the Quincy\" and has a strong sense of justice. He has also shown to be very chivalrous, stating that he enacts justice on men who abuse or treat women badly. He demonstrates this at multiple points throughout the series, such as when he tried to defend Rukia Kuchiki from Renji Abarai when he and Byakuya Kuchiki came to the real world to take her, or when he defends Orihime Inoue at multiple points throughout the Soul Society arc. Uryuu also has a tendency to not use lethal force in battle, especially if he can win without doing so. Instead, he will simply incapacitate his opponent.\n\r\nUryuu does not hold his father, Ryuuken Ishida, in high respect; he calls his father by his given name which is considered very rude in Japanese society. Despite this, in the anime Uryuu seems mildly offended when Rukia commented that the Ishida's hospital (his father being the present director) is falling apart and Renji replies tactlessly that the hospital is only for show.\n\r\nUryuu has low blood pressure and hates procrastination. The other things he hates are quite odd: buttons (despite being an expert in sewing) and the word \"haphazard.\" His favorite food is homemade mackerel miso stew. The television program he likes is Don Kanonji's \"Bura-Rei.\" The shadow that jumped out of the crowd at Kanonji's first appearance was in fact Uryuu. Like his grandfather, S\u014dken Ishida, Uryuu is left-handed.\n\n17 months after Aizen's defeat Uryuu joins Vandenreich under Yhwach's command.",

After being forced to surrender with Meg and others held hostage, Jo returns to the secret labs for reprogramming and conditioning at RAPT R&D. Jo's counterpart, Maria, freed her to only prove who was the strongest; Jo managed to remove her will to defeat her and restores her true humanity. Jo realized that she has to destroy RAPT at the source all for all that has happened as well as help Sei. Meg was highly opposed to the idea after seeing her go through a lifetime of combat and feels it's not their problem. Jo knocks Meg out, bids her farewell and leaves her communicator and jacket behind for her to remember by. After fighting their way into RAPT HQ, Jo destroyed RAPT's most powerful bio-tech brain and the whole building collapses. It is unknown whether Jo survived the explosion or not.\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He is part of the school's ky\u016bd\u014d club and often participates (and tops) school competitions. Also because of his cool and calm composure he is very popular with the girls.\n\r\nHe lives in a shrine owned by his late grandfather, a priest in which during his childhood told him a lot of stories about folklore and shinto practices. However, despite his heritage, Doumeki has a nearly null ability of seeing ghosts or spirits, though he can still exorcise them. He does seem to be able to feel spiritual \"pressure\" and have a vague sense of their presence. One spirit he did see was the Lady in the Park that Watanuki often visited.\n\r\nDoumeki has a pure or refreshing scent as noted by the Ame-Warashi. Kohane noted that Doumeki was a 'beautiful' or 'pretty' person, most likely referring to his spirit or aura. Naturally, Watanuki is bewildered (and rather agitated) by this. Doumeki cannot enter Yuuko's Store, the explanation why is later revealed on volume 8. His technique of exorcising spirits is by shooting them with an invisible arrow made of pure energy, as first revealed in volume 2.\n\nOriginally Doumeki could not see the spirits/ghosts that Watanuki could see (like that of the oden shop owner and the Ghost Girl who haunted a scary home) but after he shared both his blood and half his eye with Watanuki he was able to eventually see and experience what Watanuki goes through.\r\nDoumeki's personality is a total opposite of Watanuki's. He has a cool, calm and often sarcastic demeanor. He barely speaks unless explaining folklore or asking Watanuki for impossible bento lunches (such as asking for food that is out of season or hard to find). He also has a deadpan sense of humor that is often dark and somewhat fatalistic. Much to the annoyance of Watanuki he seems to pop up everywhere, especially when Watanuki gets a chance to be with Himawari. He often replies in a one word phrase like \"Hn\" or \"Oh\". He is also very observant, and even though he does not show it he seems to be very protective of Watanuki, such as in Volume 5 where he stood for hours in the rain to make sure Watanuki was safe and in Volume 6 during the incident with the spirit in the park. Volume 9 of the manga through Doumeki's New Years dream we find out he looks like his late grandfather Haruka. His grandfather also knows more about Doumeki's past, and bears an uncanny resemblance to his grandson (though Watanuki points out that Haruka smiles much more).\n\r\n(Source: CCS Wikia)",

Nobue is perpetually searching for a part-time job to earn money for more cigarettes to calm her nicotine addiction.\n\r\nThe story suggests that Nobue derives some kind of sensual pleasure from watching the girls do cute things. In this respect, Nobue appears to appreciate the moe aesthetic. It is seen during the anime that Nobue prefers Matsuri and Ana over Chika and Miu.\n\r\nThe Nobue character changed from the manga to the anime. In the manga, she is a sixteen-year-old high school freshman, while in the anime she is a twenty-year-old junior-college student. Her age is presumably changed because of her smoking and drinking habit, both becoming legal in Japan at age twenty. Although in the first episode of the anime she introduces herself as a sixteen-year-old, this was intended to be a joke as she quickly stated that she was twenty. \n\r\nShe tends to act somewhat less mature in her manga incarnation, doing things such as tricking Matsuri into thinking that Miu is dead. Her appearance changes radically in the early stages of the manga, especially her hair, which goes from blond to dark brown (and is black in the anime).",

He is extremely tall and appears to be much older than he actually is. Chad has a tattoo on his left shoulder which reads Amore e Morte (\"love and death\" in Italian) and consists of a heart, a snake and angel wings around the heart. In the series, he is usually seen wearing either his school uniform or a t-shirt. At one point in the series, he is seen wearing a dark, long-sleeved shirt with a rose emblazoned on the left sleeve. The rose may be in honor of his grandfather seeing as how his grandfather's name was Oscar Joaqu\u00edn de la Rosa, de la Rosa being Spanish for \"of the Rose.\"\n\r\nChad is a quiet person and is sometimes the subject of jokes or bullies because he never fights back, against ordinary humans, or often hollows and Soul Reapers until necessary. Nonetheless, he is treated equally within his group of friends in Karakura (Ichigo, Keigo and Mizuiro). Chad also has a weakness for cute things, like small animals and Kon, and is one of the few characters that actually treats Kon with any dignity but for the most part ignores him. To match his extraordinary size, Chad possesses extraordinary superhuman durability, even before activating his spiritual powers, being able to survive the impact of a falling steel girder on his back and a head-on motorcycle collision, and is strong enough to break telephone poles and wield them as giant clubs, even when already injured. Besides his physical strength, Chad has also shown to be very intelligent; he ranked 10th out of 322 in school, while Ichigo ranked 23rd.\n\r\nChad likes music, but rarely watches TV. The only programs he likes are Carnivore Kingdom, which starts at 8 a.m. on Sundays. He likes it so much that he bought the DVDs for it. Not surprisingly, since Kon is a cheap knock-off plushie of the main character of Carnivore Kingdom, Chad finds Kon especially cute. The other show is Don Kan'onji's Ghost Bust. Chad also has a bass guitar, but has never been shown playing it. It has been shown in Chad's room in episode 69 and in the 8th anime ending sequence. It's also shown in episode 12 after a \"band practice.\" He is also seen carrying it immediately preceding the appearance of the incomplete arrancar.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He serves the new Band in many of the same roles that Guts served in the old one, including being Griffith's right hand man, most trusted confidant, and strongest warrior. Zodd's ability to fly made possible both Griffith's rescue of Charlotte and Guts' attack on Ganishka at Vritannis.\n\r\nAs both a reminder of his defeat and to make the fact he is a replacement of Guts in this new band of Hawk very clear, his left horn has never regrown like Guts' missing right eye. His reason for joining the band of Hawk is much like Guts' also mainly because he was defeated by Griffith.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Unlike the Major and Lieutenant Rip van Winkle, he still wears a full uniform, which is similar to a M42 Greatcoat with its neckguard constantly turned up, and an M43 officer's cap emblazoned with the Totenkopf symbol. The Captain is a natural werewolf, able to transform at will and fight in either human or werewolf form. Hans once fought Walter and Alucard in WWII, and meets the Hellsing forces later in London. His seemingly noble behaviour does not fit very well in with the rest of Millennium, and his enigmatic behaviour makes one wonder what he is fighting for.\n\r\nThe Captain possesses immense superhuman ability, even while in human form. This includes superhuman senses, strength (strong enough to bend steel bars or shatter limbs with a single kick), speed, reflexes, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance. His iron-like flesh can withstand Walter's wires (which can easily slice solid steel), even as they are tightened around his bare neck. He seems to be able to fall great distances without sustaining any damage. The Captain has some regenerative ability, as he quickly regenerated his mutilated hand in The Dawn. In addition to his natural abilities, the Captain possesses two modified Mauser C96s with incredibly long barrels, and a combat knife that he has not used yet.\n\r\nNote: His name is not Hans G\u00fcnsche, this was a fanmade name for him because of a scene where various names appeared in the background and Hans was one of them.",

She is called Haruha Raharu; this may be another alias, however. Haruko has connections to the Nandaba family cat, Miu Miu. The cat serves as a \"walkie talkie\" to her superiors. The cat does not speak (besides its \"meows\" and grunts) but it is obvious that Haruko is getting some kind of reply as her conversations with Miu Miu are reminiscent to that of a telephone conversation.\n\r\nNaota calls Haruko Haruhara \"Haruko,\" Kamon calls her \"Haruko-san,\" and Mamimi refers to her as \"Haru-san.\" Amarao, who believes her real name to be Haruha Raharu, refers to her as \"Raharu.\"",

She projects a proper, even slightly stuck-up personality, and conceals personal information to an almost obsessive degree; she does not even let her classmates know that she needs corrective lenses, instead wearing contacts while at school. Even with her class president status, however, Eri isn't above breaking the rules to get what she wants. She rigs the voting during the casting for the school play in order to get the lead role and have Naota cast opposite her, which (along with letting him see her wearing glasses) hints at her crush on Naota. Other hints are her expressed dislike of Mamimi and a final scene with Naota by a vending machine that mirrors Mamimi and Naota's early-series interactions. Ninamori is highly intelligent, if a little jaded. Much like Naota, Ninamori attempts to act mature, and although her parents' problems trouble her deeply, she refuses to admit it until near the end of the series.",

    "name": "Mamimi Samejima",
    "description": "She has the peculiar tendency to name people and things \"Ta-kun (Or sometimes simply spelled as Takkun),\" after her personal nickname for Naota's brother (and Naota himself). The \"-kun\" suffix is an informal and intimate honorific primarily used when addressing males of equal or junior status. Mamimi is likely using Naota as a substitute for Tasuku and therefore refers to him as \"Ta-kun\" which can be short for both Naota and Tasuku. (Naota is well-aware of the similarity between his nickname and his brother's name.) Mamimi also calls Tasuku \"Tasuku-sempai\" since he is an older classmate.\n\r\nThe story originally sets forth that her fascination with fire stems from Tasuku having rescued her from the elementary school fire, although it is later hinted that she was the one who started that fire. Mamimi holds an almost quixotically weak grip on the difference between fantasy and reality; for example, she believes Canti to be the manifestation of Cantido, the video game god to whom she burns things as sacrifices. She also emanates an aura of benign vapidness that causes much of the cast (Naota's classmates especially) to look upon her with disdain and her peers to bully her. In fact, Mamimi can be exceedingly destructive\u2014although only when nobody is watching. She spends much of FLCLimax exacting retribution against those who have wronged her\u2014only to have her plan backfire.\n\r\nMamimi can be seen to lack control over her life or willpower, hence the near-constant smoking and child-like reliance on others, whether it'd be Naota or his older brother Tasuku. This could also explain why she loves taking care of things that are weak-willed, which she leaves (or which escape, like Ta-kun, the black kitten) when they start to show independence. This leads to her eventual disinterest in Naota and ultimately proves a disaster for her when her last adoptee, the terminal core from a robot, goes haywire and overpowers first her and then the military.\n\r\nAs far as high schoolers go, she seems to be rather sexually frustrated, as she often pursues an uncomfortable level of intimacy with Naota (most likely because she sees him as his brother's replacement), which annoys Naota greatly. When he asks why she constantly clings to him, she responds \"If I don't, I'll overflow.\"\n\r\nMost characters refer to Mamimi simply as Mamimi, but Naota's friends refer to her as \"Naota's Wife\" and Haruko calls her \"Sameji,\" a shortening of her last name. Amarao refers to her as \"that high school girl.\"",

Mamimi is convinced that Canti is an angel. She calls him Lord Canti after \"The God of Black Flames\" in a video game she plays.

    "description": "In the first episode he appears in (the 4th episode of the series), the viewers get the impression that he is virtually an omniscient character, giving background information as well as making fairly accurate predictions. However, subsequent events would show him as extremely weak and very limited in foresight.\n\r\nIt is a likely inference from the story that as a child he was approached by Haruko/Raharu, just like Naota, and she tried using his N.O. to contact/capture Atomsk. However, his N.O. channel is so weak that he can barely pull something the size of a slingshot through. When the prior happens in episode 5, Haruko says \"Small, as usual,\" again suggesting a previous relationship between the two, or that she has tried it with other men. One could also argue that a youthful entanglement with Haruko could have led to his career with Interstellar Immigration. There are some traces of him feeling jealous that Haruko has chosen Naota over him.\n\r\nHe has a love of sickeningly sweet candy and drinks, and hates spicy, sour, and pulpy foods\u2014much like Naota. His vehicle of choice is a Fuji Rabbit, a motor scooter which was produced initially in 1946 six months prior to the initial production of the Vespa. Given that throughout the series Amarao is constantly trying to impress Haruko, who rides a Vespa, one could conclude his ownership of a scooter is further manifestation of his attempts to impress her\u2014or at very least a signal to the level at which Haruko influenced him in his youth.",

Gaining true humanity is the focal point of her ambition, arguably much more so than the rest of the Homunculi.\n\nLust was created by Scar's brother, when he attempted to use alchemy to bring his lover back from the dead. After he was cast out from Ishbalan society as a heretic, Envy visited the wretched creature and fed it red stones, giving her human shape, and her new name. She was not the first Homunculus to bear the name of Lust, and is the third youngest Homunculus.\nIn the manga and 2009 anime series;\nLust is the only female Homunculus and the second to be created by Father. Due to her high intelligence and devotion to Father's plan, Lust appears to have a great deal of free reign and authority within the organization, seeming to have a position second only to Pride and on par with Wrath. Lust also has a great disdain for humans, thinking them frail, predictable and generally stupid. Moreover, she appears to take pleasure in using and throwing them away. Lust is the first to introduce the idea of Homunculi as superhuman, the next wave of evolution of humanity, and takes pride in her nature.\n\n-Taken in part from Wikia.",

    "description": "In the 2003 anime series:\r\nAs the oldest Homunculus, Envy claimed that he had forgotten what he originally looked like. Envy also greatly hates all humans and followed Dante mostly for the opportunity of killing as many people as he could. This is what drove Envy in all that he did and unlike other Homunculi, Envy does not care about the Philosopher's Stone, nor about becoming human.\n\nTowards the very end of the series it is revealed that Envy was created four hundred years ago by Hohenheim in an attempt to resurrect the son he and Dante had, who later died from mercury poisoning when he was eighteen years old. Envy held a great hatred toward Hohenheim for never being acknowledged as his son and for abandoning him and Dante.\nIn the manga and 2009 anime series:\r\nEnvy was the fourth Homunculus created by Father. Though often referred to as a 'he' Envy is apparently genderless and can take almost any form they choose. Referred to by Lust as the most cruel or sadistic of the Homunculi, Envy shows the most open disdain of humans and relishes in any opportunity to hurt, humiliate, or insult them. They are also quite vain and short tempered and dislike anyone insulting their appearance.\n\nBeneath this cruel exterior however Envy is secretly envious of humans' inner strength and the mutually beneficial friendships that they share, since most of the Homunculi show little real concern or emotional support for each other.\r\n(Source: Fullmetal Alchemist Wikia)",

K\u014dran raises Kurei to become a \"machine\", telling him that he does not need human emotions and that he should reject them. Upon seeing how much Kurei loved his mother, K\u014dran has her transferred to a different house and keeps her under house arrest. When Kurei falls in love with Kurenai, K\u014dran Mori's adopted daughter, K\u014dran has her killed. This causes Kurei to despise his adoptive father, but since K\u014dran is holding his mother hostage, he obeys K\u014dran's orders.\n\nKurei is the leader of the Uruha, a group of skilled warriors hired to serve K\u014dran Mori and to assist Kurei in missions that K\u014dran orders him to undertake.\n\nLike his father and his half-brother, Kurei has the innate power to produce and manipulate fire. The main form of his flame is the Phoenix, and is a different color from Recca's (Kurei's flames are purple in the anime series and a different shade of red in the Flame of Recca video games). Kurei has the ability to absorb souls into his flame, and use them to produce humanoid flames that fight for him and obey his commands. The first time Kurei absorbed a soul into his flame was when he absorbed Kurenai's soul right after K\u014dran killed her. The second instance was when he absorbed the soul of a loyal member of the Uruha named Jisho (this is not shown in the anime or the video games). His power is not limited to absorbing just one soul at a time, as shown by his absorption of several souls after an opponent slaughters many men in the latter part of the manga.\n\nKurei is also capable of executing non-flame based techniques such as Wakemi, a technique that allows him to produce multiple, solid duplicates of himself that possess his powers and skills. In the last part of the manga, he uses the Jikury\u016bri, a technique that allows its user to open a portal in time.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Although she appears to be non-klutzy on the movement scale, she's a lead weight in the water.\n\r\nHer eyes are a dark blue (brown in the anime), almost black. She has an unextraordinary nose, and a cute smile. Akane's navy blue hair is cut short and sort of boyishly (initially the cutting of her hair was accidental, but she grew to love it after accepting her long hair did not reflect her as well as it did on her sister Kasumi).\n\r\nShe doesn't like being called a \"tomboy,\" \"ugly,\" or \"uncute.\" It is quite possibly the fastest way to get malleted by Akane. The second fastest way to get malleted by Akane is to grope her. She very much dislikes perverts, nor does she like being groped. However, the usual perverts of Nerima seem to slip by much easier than Ranma does who apparently is a subconscious pervert and is always getting malleted by Akane for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\r\nAkane is a fiery young beauty. She doesn't like to be dominated or told how she should act or be. Most importantly, she is herself.\n\r\nDespite what some people would tell, Akane is a very complex person. She had different attitudes towards different people\u2014to most, she would be a sweet, good-natured person with just a hint of a quick temper. To Ranma, though, she comes off as a man-hating, violent tomboy. First impressions are a big deal with her.\n\r\nAkane has a problem with acting feminine. This is because she's had very few female role models in her life, besides Kasumi, whom for a great many years Akane modeled herself after. Almost anything that the Japanese attribute to females: tea ceremony, gymnastics, etc., Akane struggles with. Even society's rules on how a girl should act in a relationship, she defies.\n\r\nAkane has lived in the Tendou Dojo with her two sisters and father all of her life. Her mother died when she was young, and therefore for most her childhood Akane was raised by her eldest sister, Kasumi, and her father, Soun.",

To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the \"White Devil\" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.\n\r\nGintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.\n\r\nGintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a \"Bankai\" similar to the characters of Bleach.\n\r\nDespite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.\n\r\nDespite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, VS Battles Wiki, edited)",

Shinpachi is the captain of the \"Otsu's Imperial Guard,\" a pop-singer's fan club.\n\r\nShinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.\n\r\nDespite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakid\u014d-Ryu, the type of swordmanship his dojo teaches.\n\r\nIn the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.\n\r\nHis name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura.",

    "name": "Kagura ",
    "description": "Birthday: November 3\r\nZodiac: Scorpio\r\nHeight: 155 cm\r\nWeight: 40 kg\n\r\nKagura, meaning \"god-entertainment\" is a member of the Yorozuya alongside Sakata Gintoki and Shinpachi Shimura and the main female protagonist of Gintama.\n\r\nAlthough she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato people are said to have \"transparent\" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.\n\r\nShe is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.\n\r\nKagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.\n\r\nHer immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.\n\r\nShe came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.\n\r\nKagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with \"Gin-chan says...\" or \"Gin-chan told me...\"\n\r\nKagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura.\n\r\nShe regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that \"he definitely likes me,\" but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.\n\r\nAlthough Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her \"Anego\" (a term gangster women use to show respect).\n\r\nHer super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to.\n\r\nAccording to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.\n\r\nIn Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.\n\nIn the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes.\r\nDuring the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura and Shinpachi teamed up against a Yato veteran named Abuto. When Shinpachi was mortally wounded by Abuto, Kagura can no longer hold against her Yato blood and revealed her true inner killing instincts against Abuto. Abuto is easily overwhelmed by Kagura's true power.\r\nIn the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in the 6th place.",

Pu'ar graduated from the same shapeshifting academy as Oolong, although unlike Oolong, Pu'ar had completed all of the academy training and does not have Oolong's difficulties with maintaining a transformed state. Pu'ar shows up quite a bit in the beginning, but becomes less of a presence as the series continues. As the driving theme of the series is mostly about fighting, Pu'ar can do little more than react to the horrors of the latest supervillains in the story.\n\r\nThere is some debate regarding the character's gender. Despite being portrayed by several female voice actors, the character has been referred to with both male and female pronouns during the anime. Though the issue of gender is never directly addressed, Toriyama has referred to Pu'ar as \"he\" while answering a fan question in the \"Ask Me Anything\" section in the back of the manga. Some fans believe that since shape-shifters can assume many different forms, gender is a moot point.\n\r\n(Spurce: DB Wiki)",

Bulma is a direct parody of the character Xuanzang from the Chinese novel Journey to the West. Even though Bulma's character parodies a monk, her Japanese name \"Buruma\" is the brand of a popular gym short worn by girls in Japan. Her re-adapted name Bulma is a direct take on the word \"bloomers,\" which was a popular brand of women's underwear in the early 20th century.\n\r\nBulma is the second character to be introduced in the Dragon Ball series. In the early part of the story, she is the inventor of the Dragon Radar and is searching for the legendary Dragon Balls. Bulma was hoping to use the Dragon Balls to wish for the perfect boyfriend. While searching for a nearby Dragon Ball, she runs into Son Goku. It is at this time that she finds out Goku inherited one of the balls (the four-star ball) she is searching for from his Grandpa Gohan. Because of Goku's love for the ball and his belief that his Grandpa's spirit lives in the ball, Goku is not willing to give it up. Bulma then asks him to loan it for her in exchange of taking him in her travels. At that point, they team up to find the remainder of the balls and the adventure begins. In the later action-oriented episodes of the series, there is little room for a genius but Bulma continues to play a role as a secondary character, helping Goku and his friends with her gadgets, and having a rather rocky relationship with Yamcha.\n\nShe becomes Vegetas wife later on whom she has two children with: Trunks and Bulla\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, Dragon Ball Super Exciting Guide, Character Edition)",

In an attempt to rectify the accident, the alien pilot revives Hazumu but inadvertently changes his physical sex in the process.\n\r\nAfter the change and initial shock of those who know Hazumu, it is shown that she has a personality that is very effusive, expressive and quite sensitive which makes her fit well as a Japanese girl. Hazumu ends up becoming more feminine as time goes on, which is shown through her actions, mannerisms and personality. One exception to this, however, is that she never got over referring to herself using the term boku (\u50d5), meaning \"I\", which is usually only used by males in Japan.\n\r\nHazumu, as an amateur floriculturist, loves plants (more specifically flowers), and is very knowledgeable about them. She is in the Gardening Club, and takes care of a large number of plants around the school campus with the other members though is seen doing most of the work throughout the series.\n\r\nWhen the manga and anime versions of Hazumu's character are compared, it's shown that Hazumu in the anime is much more subdued and reserved when confronted with danger, which makes her depend more on the help of others.

As fate would have it, Yasuna rejected Hazumu's first confession of love for her as a boy, but later after his transformation into a girl, ironically she confesses her love to Hazumu.\n\r\nHer awkward personality and antisocial tendencies towards males in general is due to Yasuna displaying symptoms of androphobia. Astonishingly, she sees all men, minus Hazumu, as covered in a grey blur. This is mainly why she finds it easier to love Hazumu after he becomes a girl, showing much more blatant interest in Hazumu after the change.\n\r\nShe is in the Music Club and plays the flute.

Shuichi's band also begins to rise in fame, and a major portion of the series focuses on his attempts to balance the demands of his job with his pursuit of Eiri's affections.\n\r\nShuichi has an innocent and energetic personality that is indicative of the uke stereotype. This is amplified in the anime, where he frequently goes into super deformed mode, which often ruins serious scenes. Despite this hyper activeness, he also shows determination and preserverance when he buckles down and focuses on what he wants. This is evident in his zeal to get to the top of the charts with Bad Luck and his aggressive pursuit of his love interest Eiri Yuki.",

Unlike Osaki, Komatsu came from a large and happy household, though her childish outlook prevented her from living on her own initially. She's the middle child of three sisters.\n\r\nHer chance encounter with Osaki began a friendship which changes Komatsu's life forever. She is introduced to Osaki's band, Black Stones, and their members. She later even helps \"Blast\" to find their bassist, by drawing a poster to advertise the vacancy. Much to her surprise, she also discovers that the members of Blast were friends with the members of Trapnest, a popular rock band of which she's a very big fan.\n\nNana Komatsu discovers she is pregnant (revealed in chapters 25 and 26), and although she really loves Nobuo, she realizes that Takumi would be in a better position to care for her and her unborn child. She also chooses to be with Takumi because she knows that the only way Nobu would be able to care for it would be to give up playing with Blast and return to his family's inn. She doesn't want him to give up his dream, plus she wants Blast to become famous and popular more than anything. Nana K. clings to Takumi's calm attitude towards her pregnancy, and she is given strength through his kindness at that time.\n\r\nBecause of her pregnancy, she marries Takumi (initially in name only, for Takumi delayed their wedding because of Osaki's engagement to Ren). Her married name throughout the series is Nana Ichinose. As the time passes, she realizes she loves Takumi. Takumi's compliments on her cooking when they first met encourages her to improve her cooking even more and take cooking classes. She makes breakfast for Takumi everyday and draws a funny face on it with ketchup, usually stating her mood to Takumi. They both seem to have a mundane married relationship, with quarrels and making up due to her naive and forgiving nature and Takumi's forgetful nonchalant nature. She hopes that she will be able to live happily, although in the future sequences of NANA she lives in Japan while he lives in London, England.\r\n(Source: Wikia)",

She is now engaged to her first love, Ren, although she also has lingering, ambiguous feelings for Yasu. Nana's favourite things never change.

She also has the ability to cook, but prepares all her food with too much salt which only Ren seems to enjoy.\n\nIn recent chapters, Nana had started getting panic attacks due to stressful situations, causing her to have trouble breathing. This usually had to be remedied by putting a bag over her mouth to circulate carbon dioxide and regulate her breathing. Hachi wasn't aware of this problem until Chapter 81, where she helped Nana's breathing giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, providing her carbon dioxide.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, Nana wikia)",

From that point on, this man continues to weave a living nightmare for Vash, not only on his own but also through the gang of eleven superpowered killers who are under his command: the Gung-Ho Guns.\n\r\nLegato himself possesses a dark power: the ability to control people's bodies against their will.\n\nHis favorite bit of poetic justice is to make gangs of people who oppose him shoot each other, and this special power is what finally forces Vash to cross the line he promised himself he'd never cross. By controlling some villagers and pointing their guns at Meryl and Milly, he forced Vash into a choice between two unacceptable options: either allow the girls to die, or take the only possible action to save them...and kill him.\n\r\nLegato's telekinetic powers come from the fact that he has Vash's left arm. When Knives shot it off, it was attached to Legato. This is why Legato can control other people's bodies (originally one of Vash's and Knives' powers) and can activate Vash's angel arm the same way Knives did in July.\n\r\nIt is unclear how Vash's arm was transplanted to Legato, since Vash is a humanoid plant and Legato is human. One might think that perhaps Legato is also a humanoid plant, but it is made clear in the series that Legato is human and hates himself because of it. Thus we can only assume that Knives somehow \"reconstructed\" and modified Legato in some way.",

    "name": "Nicholas D. Wolfwood",
    "description": "The giant cross that he carries comes in two versions. Version 1 holds 12 pistols (across arms of the cross). Version 2 houses a giant machine gun (long part of the cross) and finally, a rocket launcher in the top, while the ammunition is stored in the arms of the cross(an alternate opinion is simply that one of the horizontal arms holds ammo for the machine gun and rocket launcher while the other holds six pistols). The trigger for the Version 2 is a skull shaped symbol in the centre of the cross. As can be expected, the weapon/case is very heavy, and only Wolfwood, Milly, and Vash seem to have no trouble holding it (though Vash once comments on its weight). The weapon is not actually named in the anime, but it is commonly referred to as Punisher, which comes from the manga. Wolfwood states that it's heavy \"with God's mercy,\" a fitting statement from the cynical Wolfwood.\n\r\nHe is modeled on Tortoise Matsumoto, the lead singer of the Japanese rock band Ulfuls. The name Wolfwood (\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5\u30a6\u30c3\u30c9 urufuddo) is a corruption of Ulfuls (\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5\u30eb\u30ba urufuruzu), which is in turn a corruption of the English word soulful (\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5\u30eb s\u014drufuru).\n\r\nNightow is frequently asked in interviews and at convention panels what the \"D.\" in Wolfwood's name stands for. His responses have varied each time, ranging from \"Dangerous\" to \"Dokonokuminomonjawaresumakinishiteshizumetarokakora.\" The latter is actually stereotypical yakuza slang, and would be written out as \"\u3069\u3053\u306e\u7d44\u306e\u8005\u3058\u3083\u3001\u308f\u308c\uff01\uff1f\u3000\u7c00\u5dfb\u304d\u306b\u3057\u3066\u6c88\u3081\u305f\u308d\u304b\u3001\u3053\u3089\uff01\", which roughly means \"What the hell family do you think you're from!? I'm gonna tie you up in a reed mat and dunk ya!\". The common theme in these various expansions of the single letter \"D\" is one of destructive force, anger, or violence, which are traits Nightow has modeled the character after.\n\r\nIn the original Japanese version, Wolfwood speaks in a Kansai Dialect. Nightow has said of this: \"It's an English-speaking world, so he's not actually speaking Kansai dialect. Think of it as indicating some accent.\"\n\nWolfwood is actually the student of the Gung-Ho Gun 'Chapel the Evergreen'. It is strongly hinted that Wolfwood would have inherited the title once his mentor completed his service to Knives. Wolfwood was taken in by Chapel as a child after escaping an abusive home situation. Nicholas was raised by his alcoholic uncle whom he eventually shot dead; this survival instinct apparently appealed to Chapel, who raised and trained Wolfwood from early adolescence. Although he is a professional killer, Chapel seems to sincerely care for his ward.\n\nSpoiler Warning for Manga Wolfwood: Wolfwood was raised in an orphanage before being inducted into the Eye of Michael, an organization of assassins founded by a plant worshipper. The Eye of Michael worships Knives as a god and provides him with contract killers. Wolfwood's teacher and master was Chapel; a man much different from his anime incarnation. During his training, Wolfwood had been physically enhanced to superhuman status, including regenerative abilities that are triggered by consuming vials of a special drug. This also speeds up his metabolism resulting in him looking much older than he really is. In the manga, Wolfwood is somewhere around 14-16 years old.\n\r\nShortly before the series begins, Wolfwood shoots his mentor, leaving Chapel without the use of his legs and taking his Master's identity so he can join the Gung-Ho Guns in his place. After the fifth moon incident, he attempts to kill Knives but is overcome by fear and is unable to move. Instead of punishing him, Knives gives Wolfwood the task of protecting his brother until Knives is able to see him again. This causes many of the other Gung-Ho Guns to assume that Wolfwood is a traitor although his actions do not directly contradict Knives' orders until Volume 8 of the manga, when Wolfwood breaks into the ark in order to rescue Vash.\n\r\nThe manga version of his weapon is part of a special series of guns named \"Punisher,\" and the highest honor in the Eye of Michael is to receive one, since the Punisher is considered to be the strongest personal weapon the Eye of Michael possesses. His teacher Chapel tells him that his Punisher is the tenth to have been built in the 133 years of history of the Eye of Michael. The manga Punisher differs from its anime counterpart slightly in coloration, and in that the two side arms of the cross are used to hold the ammunition for the main machine gun rather than additional pistols. His \"true\" Eye of Michael title is Nicholas the Punisher.\r\n(Source: Answers.com, Wikipedia, Nicholas D. Wolfwood)",

Possibly one of the best (or even the best) navigators currently sailing the Grand Line, she has the ability to recognize and analyze even the slightest changes in the weather through sheer intuition, thus saving the ship and the crew from the very unstable Grand Line weather on multiple occasions.\n\r\nNami has a tattoo on her left shoulder (a homage to her past), where she used to have a shark tattoo for being a member of Arlong's Crew. The new tattoo represents mikan (a fruit commonly know as tangerine) and pinwheels.\n\r\nShe respects Luffy's qualities as a leader, but often gets angry of his irrational thinking and short attention span, even so she trusts him with her life. Despite the fact that Nami has deceived the crew, Luffy still trusts her enough to allow her to safe-keep his precious straw hat. She is almost always the one who gives orders on the ship (much to the Zoro's resentment) because of Luffy's usual lack of common sense. She often comically beats or hits her other crewmates for their nonsense, which occurs quite often. Robin is actually the only person Nami doesn't try to boss, and she referred to her as the only person who understands her, though in a comical fashion. She is very manipulative as well and can even turn an entire conversation in her favor when necessary, often putting on disguises and tricking the enemy. Acting as the \"mother\" of the crew, Nami doesn't understand or approve of the boys' often macho attitudes and principles. These are the only situations where Nami doesn't get the final word.\n\r\nNami's two favorite things are money and tangerines. She is greedy and will do anything, aside from abandoning or killing her friends, for money. Due to her past - After having gathered money for 8 years (and even before that often stole things), Nami is naturally accustomed to it, but thinks of her friends as more important. She is very manipulative, and often takes advantage of Sanji for his devotion to her and Usopp to maintain her weapons. Roronoa Zoro tries not to fall for her schemes, but ends up a victim like the rest, usually due to debt and blackmail. Nami also tries to avoid fights, and is one of the less adventurous and brave members of the crew. However, since the invention of her Clima Tact (A weapon that forms weather patterns), she is now seen fighting her own battles instead of becoming the 'easy target,' as she doesn't want to be the one being saved anymore.",

He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who's listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in Zoro who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon \"Clima Tact.\"\n\r\nUsopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions. Also, Usopp has outstanding marksmanship abilities with his slingshot and is on his way to becoming one of the best snipers in the One Piece world, although his goal in life is to become a proud and strong pirate like his father Yasopp of the Red Haired Pirate Crew.",

Needless to say this left him with a rather painful result. Also when Buggy launched his hand out to pin down Zoro for Cabaji's Sting of the Unicycle Technique, Luffy stomped on it, inflicting tremendous pain). He also seems to require either a fixed distance from his detachments, or keep them within his line of vision, in order to manipulate them separately.\n\r\nBesides his Devil fruit abilities he usually fights with three knives between his fingers. During the flashbacks of his youth he already used these three knives. He also has a blade hidden in his shoe and in Logue Town used a sword in his failed attempt to execute Luffy.",

It is revealed that Vivi is actually the princess of Alabasta, but infiltrated Baroque Works as Miss Wednesday to find the identity of the leader, who turns out to be the Shichibukai member Sir Crocodile.

It was a word often used to describe Egyptian queens and princesses. Oda admitted the Alabasta arc was based around ancient Egypt, but apparently had no clue on what the word meant when he chose the name. \n\r\nDespite her long absence from the series and her separation from ties to the Straw Hat crew, Vivi was featured on the cover page of chapters 271, 423 and 484, usually reserved to Straw Hats. That makes her the only non-Straw Hat other than the Going Merry to appear on a cover page. \n\r\nIn the English manga and anime, her name is romanized as \"Nefeltari Vivi\". \n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Overall, he is greatly respected by most of the characters, despite having a \"soft\" and friendly nature and never appearing in actual combat until he started a fight with Whitebeard. As a whole, he does not make many appearances in the series, although he appears in a majority of the opening or closing themes of the anime.\n\r\nShanks always wears a long black cape over his shoulders and until he met Luffy, wore a straw hat that he had worn for many years beforehand. He always wears trousers that are cut below the knee as well as a pair of sandals. The most striking thing about Shanks is the color of his red hair, of which his nick-name \"Red Haired Shanks\" comes from. He also has three scars across his left eye, which were given to him by Blackbeard a long time ago. He has a missing left arm, that he had lost when he saved Luffy from a Sea King. Shanks and his crew are almost always seen partying and drinking alcoholic beverages whenever they make an appearance as the Captain's favorite pastimes are attending and hosting parties and banquets.\n\r\nAccording to Oda, Shanks is the one character that resembles himself the most out of all the One Piece characters, because of his fun-loving partying nature.",

With Water Release: Water Dragon Blast Technique (Suiton: Suiry\u016bdan no Jutsu, Viz \"Water Release: Water Dragon Missile\") he can form a dragon from the surrounding water to attack others as needed. His Water Release: Great Waterfall Technique (Suiton: Daibakufu no Jutsu, English TV \"Water Style: Giant Vortex Jutsu\") allows him to fire a massive spiraling blast of water at an opponent. In addition to the offensive capabilities of his water jutsu, Zabuza is very skilled in assassinations. By blanketing the area in mist with Hiding Mist Technique (Kirigakure no Jutsu, Viz \"Art of Hiding in the Mist\"), Zabuza can blind an opponent and use his training as an ANBU to find them based on the sounds they make. Once found, Zabuza uses Silent Homicide Technique (Muon Satsujin Jutsu, English TV \"Silent Killing Jutsu\") to kill the opponent without their noticing his presence. This talent with assassinations is very well-known, as even the ninja of Konohagakure are familiar with Zabuza's history.\n\nZabuza is hired by Gato to kill the bridge builder Tazuna. After his initial attempt fails to kill Tazuna and his escorts (Kakashi Hatake and his students) and leads to his defeat, Zabuza and Haku seek a rematch after he recovers. Once tracking down Team 7 again, Zabuza is drawn into battle with Kakashi while Haku deals with his students. Although he tries to avoid Kakashi, he is eventually restrained and Kakashi prepares to kill him with his Lightning Blade. Before he can land a blow, however, Haku appears to use himself as a human shield for Zabuza, fulfilling his promise of being a tool for his master. Zabuza is freed as a result of Haku's intervention and tries to attack Kakashi, though Kakashi is able to avoid the attack and make both of Zabuza's arms useless. With Zabuza no longer able to fight, Gato arrives with his henchmen to finish the job instead, ending the battle between Zabuza and Kakashi. Naruto Uzumaki, however, is angered that Zabuza has yet to show remorse for Haku's death and explains Haku's devotion to him. Brought to tears by his words, Zabuza reveals that he did care for Haku and decides to repent for what he has done. After taking a kunai in his mouth, Zabuza charges through Gato's men, being stabbed multiple times along the way though eventually reaching and killing Gato. After collapsing due to his injuries Zabuza asks to be brought to Haku's side, wanting to be by his side in death as Haku was by his in life. Kakashi complies, and in his dying moments Zabuza wishes to go to the same afterlife as Haku.\n\nShinobi World War Arc \n\nIn preparation for the Fourth Shinobi World War, Zabuza is resurrected by Kabuto Yakushi to fight against the Allied Shinobi Forces, before being mobilised alongside Haku, Gari, Pakura and Toroi. Overhearing Zabuza as he told Haku that they were no longer in the afterlife, Gari informs them of their current situation, infuriating Zabuza because he didn't want to obey someone who would stoop so low as to use the dead. Ambushed by the Surprise Attack Division, Haku protects them both from the explosive tags carried by Sai's ink birds, but Zabuza calls it unnecessary once he observes the others regenerating. This irritates Zabuza further, who remarks that not only were they brought back, they were also made impossible to kill. Stating that he was the only one amongst his group to not possess a Kekkai Genkai, Zabuza storms the recently grounded opposition but is intercepted by Kakashi, whom he didn't expect to fight again. Greeting Sakura and noting her growth since they last met, Zabuza enquires about Naruto, learning from Kakashi how famous he had become since his death. \nAs Kabuto erases their consciousness, Zabuza pleads with Kakashi to stop him no matter what it took, as his humanity was already dead. Enveloping the battlefield in a thick mist, Zabuza then assualts the Third Division, until he is confronted by Kakashi. Amidst the battle, the previous generation of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist are summoned to the field in order for Akatsuki to retain the upper hand, with Zabuza soon joining them whilst wielding his broken Kubikirib\u014dch\u014d.\nIn the end of the fight Zabuza is captured by Ensui Nara and sealed by Maki.",

    "name": "Yuusuke Urameshi",
    "description": "Yuusuke has brown eyes and short black hair, which he usually keeps slightly-spiked with hair gel. He has around half a dozen small bangs which he doesn't keep spiked. Instead of wearing the school-issued blue uniform of Sarayashiki Junior High, he wears a identically-designed green uniform. He does this in direct rebellion of the school's strict dress code. Throughout the series, Yuusuke's clothing changes, but he usually wears some type of fighter's garb. Yuusuke looks rather-skinny, a stark contrast to his unusual strength. At the beginning of the series, he was also quite short as seen when Keiko points out he was shorter than she was. \n\r\nHaving no father and with his mother always off somewhere else, getting drunk or partying, Yuusuke has grown up in a very neglectful environment. He's short tempered, impulsive, and likes to intimidate those who are afraid of him. One of his most notable traits is his desire to fight, which becomes more noticeable as the series progresses. Yuusuke has been noted on many occasions to being rather unintelligent and, at times, just plain stupid. Yuusuke's desire to fight is more out of enjoyment of a good brawl, and surprisingly Yuusuke doesn't like killing if he can avoid it.\n\r\nEven though Yuusuke is feared by most students; and severely disliked by almost all of the teachers, he is generally misunderstood. Keiko Yukimura is one of the very few who knows Yuusuke is actually very kind, and she sympathizes with his problems in life. Yuusuke and Keiko quickly develop strong feelings for each other; and he is fiercely protective of her, almost always worrying about her well-being. Yuusuke initially didn't like Kuwabara, but as the series progresses, the two develop a mutual bond and respect for each other, with Kuwabara being the only person who truly understands him. Yuusuke and Hiei have a serious rivalry and, at times, Yuusuke seems almost intimidated by Hiei's remarkable skills. Yet, each of them has respect for the other, and will put their lives on the line to help one another. Yuusuke is very close to Kurama and has a great amount of confidence in him. Yuusuke respects Kurama's wisdom, sometimes looking to him for leadership advice when he's not sure what to do.",

    "name": "Kazuma Kuwabara",
    "description": "Kuwabara has a tough older sister named Shizuru Kuwabara. She and Yukina are the only characters known to call him by his given name. In the anime, Kazuma and Shizuru's parents never appear and are rarely, if ever, even acknowledged. His father does makes a brief appearance in the final volume of the manga to reveal that Yukina is going to be living with them and appears to be aware of the Reikai, etc. As the show progress, Kuwabara's and Yusuke's relationship evolves from rivals to best friends, although the two still disagree constantly. Kuwabara and Kurama are quite cordial with each other, but Kuwabara shares no love for Hiei, and both will readily mention their hatred of the other, although in truth deep down they are friends. \n\r\nKuwabara's most unusual ability is his sensitivity to Reiki, or Spirit Awareness. He and his band of friends call this \"the Tickle.\" Kuwabara has the ability to sense when ghosts and the paranormal are around, can see spirits and other demons, and can predict motives of others. Kuwabara can also create a blade out of his own spirit energy (known as the Rei Ken, or Spirit Sword). Although he first needed a piece of wood as a physical entity to create it, Kuwabara was able to practice and be able to create his own after one month (six months in the English anime). During his training, Kuwabara's sword is able to extend and shrink to his whim, and he can even create two, one in each hand.\n\r\nKuwabara, unlike the rest of his teammates, can be reckless, but is extremely loyal to his friends and has a very strict code of honor. He would do anything for his friends and for love but can be quite crafty in battle when he needs to be, and he is widely considered as the nicest of the four.\n\nGenkai knows the truth: that Kuwabara's spirit awareness is so high that his own body was aware of Sensui's plan months before it happened, and has undergone a transformation to prepare for it. While preparing for the finals of the Dark Tournament he is able to create a massive prismatic blade, of pure Spirit Energy, which also generates a unique, almost-electrical, aura that crackles around his entire body and improve both his offense and defense, this is known as Tameshi No Ken or The Trial Sword.\nKuwabara is unable to access his powers during his fight against Kiyoshi Mitarai (aka Sea Man), a human teenager gifted with the ability to create indestrucible monsters made of water. Faced with the possible death of his friends, Kuwabara's powers awaken and he gains the power to slice through dimensional barriers with a new type of energy sword called the Jigen Tou, or Dimensional Blade.",

    "name": "Kurama ",
    "description": "Kurama is generally regarded as the most calm and level-headed member of the group. His analytical nature is present in battle where he prefers to study the strengths and weaknesses of his opponents before devising a strategy of his own.\n\r\nHe is protective of those he cares about and is often merciless to anyone that poses them a threat, a shift in his usually friendly manner. In many instances, Kurama has shown to be very self-sacrificing in the interests of the safety of his friends and family.\n\r\nYouko Kurama was a cold hearted and ruthless thief and the most feared bandit in Makai. He was considered to be an A-class demon (though he eventually surpasses that), and is said to be more than a thousand years old.\n\r\nAfter being wounded by a bounty hunter while in his spirit fox form, Kurama sent his spirit into the Ningenkai (human world) where his spirit took refuge within an unborn child that had not yet gained a soul. It was from this point that Kurama made the transfer to a human body with the intention to recover his strength as the child developed. Kurama planned to leave Ningenkai to return to Makai after regaining his strength after an estimated ten years. However, sometime during or before the tenth year, an act of selflessness by his mother, Minamino Shiori, opened Kurama's eyes to pain he had caused his mother while growing up. Thus, he decides to continue living his human life as Shiori's son.\n\r\nKurama's special ability is that he can turn plants into deadly weapons by manipulating his youki into that plant. Kurama has complete control over any Human Realm plant and has some control over Demon Realm plants. However Demon Fox Kurama has complete control over Demon Realm Plants and has more power than regular Kurama. The strength of Kurama's moves depends on how much aura Kurama uses. He has an incredible sense of smell and he can read lips. Though Kurama is considered the second weakest of the four main fighters, topping out at low S-class power by the end of the series, he is easily the smartest fighter of the four. He relies on cunning and tactics and not necessarily power to win battles.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "He wears a white headband that conceals his Jagan Eye, which is placed on his forehead and has a purple iris. His eyes are reddish in tint, very large and slightly slanted, giving him in the beginning of the series a very sinister look. He normally wears a black cloak-like jacket and pants, with a black (and on occasion blue) undershirt. His hair is black with a blue tint, and usually spiked with white highlights on the front. Hiei wields a sword, which he can use both as a combat weapon and as a way to safely channel the dark flames from the underworld which he rarely uses as he finds it \"barbaric\". On top of a very well-muscled frame he has high speed, accuracy and precision.\n\r\nHiei is a male fire demon born to a race of female ice demons. His mother, Hina, is forced to abandon him because koorime prohibit male children. Hiei is taken in by a group of thieves, and he learns to kill at a very young age. Throughout his childhood, his one shred of sanity is a necklace made from his mother's hiruiseki (\u6c37\u6d99\u77f3, ice tear stone). He eventually loses the necklace in the heat of battle. In order to find the lost hirui, Hiei acquires the Jagan. He uses the Jagan to seek out the place of his birth and learns that his grief-stricken mother committed suicide; Hiei also learns that he has a twin sister, Yukina, who has disappeared from the village. He now has another goal, to search for Yukina. Hiei is aloof, elusive, and misanthropic, often belittling and mocking humans and their emotions.\n\r\nAlthough relatively taciturn, he occasionally squabbles with and insults his teammates, especially Kuwabara but deep down he holds a certain amount of respect for him and vice versa. In fact, Hiei respects all his teammates, but seems to be closest to Kurama and Yusuke. Hiei prefers to work on his own agenda, and has a notorious reputation in Demon World as a killer even when he was a D Class demon. Despite this, deep down he is a loner that wants true friendship and companionship. He is very honorable, always keeping his word.",

Yusuke tries to not get her involved with his spirit detective escapades, though interferences from Hiei and the Four Beasts prevent this. Keiko asks Botan to explain Yusuke's scenario to her after the ordeal is over. Botan instead does not explain it all to her mainly for safety reasons and instead tells her an almost unbelievable lie, though Keiko believes. Keiko finds out the rest during the Dark Tournament when she goes there with Botan and Kazuma Kuwabara's older sister, Shizuru. Since then, Keiko supports her friend in the adventures he goes on, staying by their sides during the Sensui arc for moral support along with Shizuru.\n\nYusuke and Keiko, who are childhood friends, are closer to each other than they would like to admit. Towards the end of the anime, Yusuke stops by her parents ramen restaurant and proposes to Keiko. It's a really tender moment until her father interrupts, saying how Yusuke always used to do that whenever Keiko got upset with him. She doesn't really say anything, but Yusuke doesn't need it to know she has accepted, and Keiko spends the next three years studying hard in a famous all-girls school, called Dai-ichi School for Girls in the English anime. At the end of the anime, after a meeting with the major part of her friends, Keiko finds herself looking at the beach. She then screams at the sea, \"I'm tired of waiting for you, Yusuke!\" He then shows up next to her unexpectedly saying \"I don't want you to wait either,\" She is in shock, yet jumps onto him and hugs him, bringing him to the ground. As she stares into his eyes, she kisses him, showing that even after Yusuke made her wait for so long, she still loves him.",

Typically, when Botan fights, she tends to favor blunt instruments like her oar, a metal bat, or, if all else fails, her fists. In her human form, Botan can use any of Yusuke's detective items. In one scene during the episode \"Setting the Trap,\" Botan was planning to use the Concentration Ring to blow up walls, which suggests she might have spirit powers like Yusuke, but they are undisclosed.

Genkai is a legendary reiki master, known both in the human and demon realms. Yusuke ends up winning the tournament, defeating Rando in the process, and is taken on as a student by Genkai. When she was 50 years younger, Genkai and the younger Toguro brother were lovers and teammates in an earlier Dark Tournament. After winning, Toguro decides to become a demon, while Genkai returns to the human world, creating a split in their relationship. She enters the next Dark Tournament with Yusuke, disguising herself as the \"Masked Fighter\" in order to once again face Toguro. Her signature technique is the Spirit Wave, an outpouring of spirit energy from the whole body which can be directed through several different variations. This makes her technique effective in healing and purification, in addition to combat. A side effect of using this power is a shifting of the body's cells which leads to a temporary reversion to the form in which the wielder was at their most powerful in life. In Genkai's case, it allowed her to briefly regain her youth.\n\r\nAlthough Genkai is of advanced age and her physical and spiritual strength had gone down, she is still a fighter to be respected and feared. Even after she gave up most of her power to Yusuke, she still is capable of using some Reiki notably during the Chapter Black saga.\n\nShe dies when she fights Toguro.",

Kohta has repressed traumatic memories of witnessing the deaths of his father and sister, which later in the plot is revealed to be by Lucy's hand when she believes he's in love with Yuka and feels betrayed. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder brought on by the trauma of this event, caused him to end up in a psychiatric ward for over a year following the event. Due in part to his loss, Kohta is sympathetic towards girls in trouble and is extremely generous and protective to the girls around him, because he can relate to them and they remind him of his late younger sister, Kanae.\n\nHe meets Lucy in his childhood when she is burying her dead puppy and running away from the orphanage where she killed 4 children. In the anime, he was visiting his cousin with his family and decided to go to the mountain to draw, taking with him a music box he had recently purchased which plays Lilium. He strikes up a conversation with her when she apparently likes the song from the music box. He finds her horns fascinating and gives her a hat to cover them up while in public, believing Lucy hates them. He asks her if they could be friends and spends time with her. He takes her to the zoo, telling her that he likes to look at the \"strange animals.\" In Lucy's hallucination, she perceives this as the reason why he was so nice to her. He lies to her about the gender of his cousin by saying that Yuka is a boy so Lucy wouldn't be upset or jealous. When she finds out that he lied to her, she stows away onto his train, where Kohta is initially happy to see her. His sister, however, is terrified of Lucy, having seen her kill several dozen people at the fair. While attempting to protect her brother, Lucy rips her in half and decapitates his father. Before she goes to kill Yuka, a traumatized Kohta knocks her down and begs her to stop killing people.\n\nIn the Anime...\n...Kohta's repressed memories are triggered when Lucy kills a whole army in front of him, afterwards singing Lilium, the song that brought them together. He is more forgiving in the anime, effectively stating that she became a monster because everyone treated her like one, even kissing Lucy and stating that he still loves her and her Nyu persona though he proclaims that he cannot bring himself to fully forgive her for the murder of his family. \n\nIn the Manga...\n\n...he is truly unforgiving towards her for killing his father and sister. He, however, considers Nyu innocent of her more violent half's actions. Even though he was injured from trying to save her earlier, Kohta still decides to confront Lucy again, once again reiterating his desire for revenge. However, because both Nyu and Lucy share a body, he cannot bring himself to carry out his vengeance and instead offers her a peaceful life so long as she promises never to harm a human being again.\n\nAlthough Lucy initially agrees, a chain of events lead to her instincts betraying her and Kohta once again mortally wounded. She almost destroys the world in her despair, but manages to subdue her violent instincts upon deciding to save his life in return for hers. Upon regaining consciousness, Kohta finds that Lucy is literally melting away from her last act of selflessness. Unfortunately, the violent personality once again breaks through and starts assaulting the world once more. Kohta shoots and kills her at both Lucy and Nyuu's urgings, thus stopping Lucy's violent rampage once and for all. He names his daughter Nyuu in her memory and is seen visiting Lucy's puppy's grave over the years in order to honor a promise he'd made to her in their childhood. He then discovers a note Lucy had written and signed with her real name (Kaede) with Nyuu's help, buried near the stone. Kohta finally can fully forgive Lucy for the slaughter of his family upon reading it. As he is crying, Nyuu calls to a girl named \"Kaede\" and two twin girls with ribbons in their hair appear, heavily implied to bear some connection to Lucy and Nyuu. One states that they've been waiting for their special friend, to which Kohta finally turns around, smiling in joy with tears in his eyes.",

She kills Kohta's father and sister out of jealousy when Kohta goes to a festival with his cousin Yuka, which causes Kohta immense mental trauma that makes him forget about her and his cousin.\nAt the end of the manga it is revealed that her real name is Kaede. Coincidentally Kaede was also the name of the inn Kohta lived in, \"Kaede/Maple Inn.\"\nShe is aware of her \"Nyu\" state as revealed in the manga by her worries just before she reverts. \"Lucy\" is not actually her real name, but the name of her inner Diclonius killing instinct that wants to exterminate mankind, her real name is \"Kaede.\"",

    "description": "Rose Bride: Anthy Himemiya\r\nSword: Shinai, Sword of Dios, Rapier\r\n(Anime) Drive to Duel: (progressively) the desire to protect Anthy.\r\nBlood type: B\r\nMyers Briggs personality type: ESFP\r\nBirthday: December 29\n\r\nIn all versions of the story Utena is a tomboyish, courageous and na\u00efve character who lives to emulate the idealized prince figure from her childhood. She is forthright, honest, and friendly, and nearly all the girls in school adore her.\n\nIn the manga series, her parents died when she was six years old. On that day she was wandering around, lost, and she fell through a hole in a fence that enclosed a river area. Utena nearly drowned but was saved by a mysterious Prince who kissed away her tears and told her that if she did not lose her noble heart, they would meet again. He left with her a rose signet ring (the Rose Seal as it is called by the duelists). Later on, Utena receives picture cards that give her clues as to where her prince is. By following these clues, she finds herself at Ohtori Academy.\n\r\nIn the anime, the initial story the anime presents is almost identical to that of the manga, except with more detail. Flashbacks show the young Utena climbing into a coffin upon her parents' deaths, seeing no point to living. She encounters the Prince, and \u2014 for reasons which eventually become key to the show's resolution \u2014 this encounter created in her the drive to become a Prince herself. Utena does not remember much of this encounter, and for the most part Utena herself does not clearly remember the full details of her history, until the very end.\n\r\nIn both the anime and manga, Utena accidentally becomes a Duelist and wins Anthy as the Rose Bride. Though critical of the Duels for objectifying Anthy, her honest desire to protect Anthy as a well as a drive to act like a prince lead her to become an active participant. As the series passes, her nobility is continuously tested, until she is finally forced to confront her own hypocrisy.\n\r\nIn the movie, Utena travels to Ohtori Academy after supposedly breaking up with her past boyfriend Touga. It is also assumed that after her seperation with Touga she was in an emotional turmoil that led her to the academy. However, she sees him on her first day on campus. Her hair is cut short, giving her more of a male's appearance, causing Saionji to initially mistake her for a boy. Additionally, Utena is a more bisexual character in the movie being coquettish with Wakaba and does not seem to mind her more boyish appearance. She is extremely troubled by Touga's apparent abandonment of her, and her interactions with Anthy express a level of introversion not present in the anime series, though she also shows an unpredictable streak and is once physically violent towards Anthy in anger. This is said by fans to be Utena's adoption of a more masculine personality. Initially Utena's aim to be a prince is more subtle than prominent compared to the anime series. It is Touga's supposed abandonment of her that caused her to feel that she must be more independent and a \"prince\" by nature. Though she states that Touga was always the prince she wanted the movie deals with her own metamorphosis in becoming a prince. Many fans noted that Utena and Anthy seemingly swap personalities in the movie, and that Utena is the one who must be saved by Anthy. Their physical appearances also seem to mirror their respective series incarnations(seeing that Utena has wavy hair and Anthy has straight hair which was the opposite in the series).",

    "description": "Zodiac sign: Pisces\r\nHeight: 152.5 cm\r\nBlood type: AB\r\nMyers Briggs personality type: INFJ\n\r\nA mysterious and shy girl whose sometimes vapid expression and superficial politeness seem to mask something deeper. Many people project their wants or desires onto her, and she's often the target of their eventual rage or hate. Her \"doormat\" behavior belies a far more complex personality.\n\r\nAnthy appears to house the Sword of Dios within her own body. At the beginning of a duel, she slips into a trance and the Sword manifests, protruding from her chest so that her champion may draw it from her. This Sword is said to be a key to reaching the goal of Revolution, and in her position as the Rose Bride Anthy is said to be the key to obtaining it.\n\nAnthy exhibits other unusual abilities as well, including magically embellishing Utena's uniform before the duel. She seems to be able to completely alter her appearance, or at least induce others to see her for someone other than who she really is. Likewise, there is some indication that she has the ability to transform others as well (as in the episode, \"The Cowbell of Happiness\").\n\r\nAccording to the Adolescence of Utena manga, Anthy is in fact responsible for the dueling of which she is the prize. When her prince Dios (or Akio) died, she became reborn as the Rose Bride. When she took this role, the Dueling Arena appeared and the \"game\" was set in motion so another \"Prince\" could take Akio's place. In the anime series the duels are a strategic game set in motion to restore Akio's former powers and open the Gate of Revolution.\n\r\nIn the movie, she seems happier and is much more sexually aggressive towards Utena. Her physical appearance is also changed, as she does not wear glasses and her hair is loose (similar to her appearance in the last few episodes of the anime). The design of her dress is also different, being mainly white. Anthy seemingly saves Utena by encouraging her to move past her vice (Touga) and seemingly rescues Utena in a subversion of the damsel in distress archetype.\n\r\nIn the anime, she appears to be servile and obedient to all, especially her current Victor, whose every wishes she must cater to. Because of this, many Duelists believe that she lacks a personality and thoughts of her own, and she is treated badly by them. However, Anthy only pretends to be so in order to keep them in the Duels, and often enjoys subtly taking revenge on those around her.\n\r\nBoth the anime and manga feature similar\u2014but altogether different\u2014circumstances wherein Anthy becomes the Rose Bride. In the movie, the world views her brother, Dios, as a prince. In reality, he is the tainted Lord of the Flies. He commits suicide when one of his most shameful secrets is revealed to Anthy, causing her to establish the Duels in order to find a replacement prince. Anthy later wholeheartedly accepts Utena as the prince she had been waiting for, but instead of staying, Utena decides that the two of them should travel to the world \"outside\" Ohtori where they will not be bound by the ideas of prince and princesses.\n\r\nIn the anime, Dios is an actual prince who saves of the girls in the world on a daily basis. The work eventually weakens him to the point of death, but the world still demands his services. Anthy ends up facing an angry mob alone in order to protect him, and is stabbed by a million swords. The swords eventually take a life of their own, eternally thirsting for a prince's blood. To combat the pain, Anthy splits herself in two, and seals the part of her containing the swords beyond the Rose Gate, becoming the Rose Bride. This incident destroys Dios' nobility and he is also split in two. One part of him becomes an altruistic but powerless ghost, while the other part becomes Akio. No longer a prince, Akio no longer has Dios's power, and establishes the Dueling Game to regain it. Anthy accepts her role as the Rose Bride despite the suffering it inflicts on her because she does not want to live in a world which had tortured her and her brother.\r\nAnthy appears to be an Asian Indian, probably Tamil. She is noticeably darker than the other characters and wears a bindi mark or jewel.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "Myers Briggs personality type: ENFJ\r\nSword: Sword of Dios\n\r\nAnthy's older brother, the acting chairman of the academy. Although barely present in the first season of the show, he later plays a pivotal role in the second and third seasons. His given name derives from the Japanese name for Venus, the Morning Star, which is identified with Lucifer.\n\nIn his youth, Akio and Dios (Spanish word for \"God\") were apparently one and the same, but he became corrupted and lost his purpose as a \"prince.\" Given the origin of his name and his role in the story, Akio may be compared to a fallen angel. In the manga, Anthy split the two intentionally; in the anime his fall is more vague\u2014it appears to be catalyzed by Anthy, but likewise also by his own loss of faith in the world which tortures both him and his sister. In order to regain the power he lost when he lost his nobility, he creates the Dueling Game in order to create a Duelist with a sword noble and powerful enough to break the Rose Gate sealing his lost power. In the movie, \"Dios\" is merely an illusion created by Anthy to hide her brother's flaws so she can have a hero to believe in.\n\r\nIn the anime, Akio uses Utena's familiarity with his \"better half\" to his advantage and becomes her lover. He expresses a desire to see her as his princess and to relieve her of the burden of becoming a prince. In the end, however, he uses her in the same way he uses all the other duelists, though she rebels against his idea of turning her into a submissive princess.\n\r\nAkio appears to dominate his sister Anthy both personally and sexually; their incestuous and power-driven relationship is key to Anthy's behavior in both the anime (where Anthy is, or pretends to be, held in thrall to her brother) and the movie (where events cause the balance of power to shift dramatically). However, the power is not completely held by Akio, as he is dependent upon Anthy for various reasons. In the anime, Akio appears to show genuine love for Anthy, and even feels her pain, but he is driven by his selfishness and very nature to continue his role in the duels. He grieves over his lost role of the Prince, but\u2014as Anthy herself points out\u2014he chose the path he walked down.\n\r\nAkio is also a remarkable playboy with many and varied conquests. The list includes Kanae, Utena, Kozue, Tokiko, Touga, and even Kanae's mother; there are also insinuations involving Saionji and Wakaba. Akio's trademark symbol is his jazzy automobile, in which he invites friends, Duelists, and potential sexual partners to take a midnight ride. Creator Ikuhara has stated Akio's general appearance and presentations, as well as his car, are meant to represent the adult world and adult power.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

His crush on Anthy in the anime (but on Utena in the manga) develops when he realizes that they remind him of his estranged sister.

All the females of the school, even older ones, idolize him, but Kozue threatens any girls who attempt to get too close to him.

While viewers are at first led to believe that Shiori stole Juri's boyfriend from her, it is later revealed that it was in fact Shiori who Juri cared about all along.\n\r\nJuri adamantly insists that she doesn't believe in miracles, and wants the power of the Rose Bride to disprove the power of miracles. However, she desperately wishes for a miracle in order to resolve her situation with Shiori. Her hardened, bitter attitude often puts her in conflict with Utena because her naivete and optimism remind her of the person she once was.\n\r\nShe wears a locket with Shiori's picture inside, and in the Black Rose arc, Shiori learns of Juri's feelings after Mikage shows her the contents of the locket. In the third arc, Utena breaks Juri's locket during her final duel, prompting her to throw the match.\n\r\nJuri is depicted in both versions as having learned all she knows about swordsmanship from an older student, Ruka Tsuchiya. In the manga, Touga reveals that Juri only became interested in him after Ruka disappeared. In the anime, Juri's true feelings are much more ambiguous, as she denies having any romantic interest in Ruka. In both versions, Ruka returns to the Duels despite serious illness in order to give Juri the power of miracles and save her from her burdens. Though they are unable to beat Utena, Juri is finally freed from her problems with Shiori by the end of her final duel. Juri and Utena's relationship then becomes more peaceful, with Juri jokingly asking for Utena's picture so she could put it in her new locket.\n\r\nIn the final episode of Utena, Juri tells a story about her elder sister, who nearly drowned. In her story, a boy dies trying to save her older sister; this was played upon in the movie (see below). Her final appearance shows her training her fencing club members, including the newly inducted Shiori.\n\r\nIn the manga, Juri is student council treasurer. Her nickname is 'The Beautiful Leopard' and she is the captain of the fencing club. In the manga, there is no Shiori; Juri is in love with Touga instead. Touga, however, is in love with Utena, and so Juri sees Utena as her arch-rival. Juri takes a far more actively antagonistic role against Utena in the manga, almost more similar to Nanami's role in the anime.\n\r\nIn Adolescence of Utena, Juri is the president of the Student Council (the Council's members are apparently Miki, Juri and Saionji). According to Wakaba, her nickname is \"The Prince.\" She allows Shiori to manipulate her, but feels trapped by Shiori as well.\n\r\nIn the scene wherein a young Touga jumps into the river to save the drowning girl, leaving Utena behind on the land, we never see the girl's face or are told who she is. In the interview with Ikuhara in the extras included with the English release of the movie, Ikuhara reveals that the girl in the boat is, in fact, Juri herself (this is possibly why Juri plays \"Prince\" to Shiori, because she feels guilty for Touga's death). This is likely a play on Juri's story in the last episode of the TV series (\"Someday, Together, We'll Shine\" or \"Someday, Shine With Me\" as the closer translation of the original title), wherein it was her older sister who nearly drowned.\n\r\nJuri's older sister never appears in the anime, movie, or manga.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "Rose Bride: Kyouichi Saionji\r\nSword: Katana, Sword of Dios, Longsword\r\n(Anime) Drive to Duel: To possess the power of the \"World Revolution\" simply for the sake of possessing power\r\nBlood type: A\n\r\nPresident of the Student Council, Touga is an arrogant and handsome young man whose desire to be powerful drives him to cruel and unscrupulous deeds. Although he says that he wishes to be noble, he has little empathy towards anyone, and his powers of manipulation are second only to Akio. He also shares his playboy attiude and has many female conquests. He is a childhood friend of Saionji, although their relationship took a turn for the worse at a point in their childhood that is the centerpiece of their respective personal journeys.\n\nToward the end of the series, however, Touga's facade of chivalry is replaced with an apparently truer concern for Utena, to the extent that he very subtly attempts to substitute his head for hers on Akio's chopping block. Arguably, this is also an example of Touga's inability to see Utena as who she really is, rather than in a stereotypical feminine role. He also seems to have moral objections to homosexuality, as he lectures Nanami when he mistakenly believes that she has admitted to being a lesbian. Despite this, he seems to have no qualms about \"taking a ride\" with Akio and manipulates his sister into dueling Utena during the Akio arc.\n\r\nThe Manga portrays Touga as taking a more obvious and definite personal love for Utena. He vows to serve her when she defeats him in their second duel, and tries his best to protect her from the machinations of Ends of the World. In the anime, this does not happen until the end of the series, and Touga's concern for Utena is far more ambiguous.\n\r\nIn the movie Touga's significance is amplified and his bad-traits completely removed. He is not a flirtatious, over-confident playboy but a man who sees and knows Utena and loves her. He is her childhood love and a significant figure in Utena's psyche. His seeming abandonment of Utena is the reason for her wish to become a prince, but as the movie progresses, Touga is revealed to be a ghost, who died to save a young girl (Juri) while he was with Utena. There is also an apparent love triangle consisting of Utena, Juri, and Shiori, and is a major reason for the conflict between the three. Near the end of the movie Utena's repressed memory of his death is uncovered and she accepts it, allowing his spirit to vanish from Earth.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Nanami often makes various malicious attacks on students she deems inferior (or worse, those she suspects Touga is paying attention to). After Touga is wounded in a duel with Utena, she temporarily takes over as Student Council President, adopting a bright yellow uniform. In duels, Nanami uses a style of dual blade fencing.\n\r\nA few filler episodes in the series are specifically dedicated to Nanami and are usually stand-alone type situations, breaking the convention of a standard Utena episode. Each has a metaphorical theme exploring Nanami's character in a sympathetic light, but are otherwise \"gag episodes,\" meant to be humorous and are especially notorious for their bizarre content.\n\r\nNanami is not a main character in the manga and is only seen once in a picture with Touga. She is seen only once in the movie, in a reference to an episode in which she was transformed into a cow.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He is temperamental, egotistic, prone to angry rages, often cruel, and extremely possessive of Anthy. His belief that they are destined to be together no matter what drive him to be physically violent towards her and continue to pursue her even after their engagement is broken.\n\r\nHe and Touga practice kendo together, but Saionji is clearly very resentful of Touga, and especially cannot bear to be humiliated by him (a fact which Touga shamelessly exploits). Saionji is less perceptive, intelligent, and skilled as Touga, and despite his best efforts can never seem to best him. He is regardless affected by this estrangement from his childhood friend.\n\nThough he stays for a short time with Wakaba Shinohara (whose crush on him and subsequent rejection were the catalyst for Utena's first duel) after being expelled from school. His obsession with Anthy ultimately draws him back, setting off a chain of events in the Black Rose Arc. He also tries unsuccessfully to covertly continue his relationship with Anthy through an \"exchange diary.\" Near the end of the series Saionji and Touga uncover parts of their shared past and seemingly reconcile their relationship by the end of the series.\n\r\nIn the movie, Saionji has a fairly small part. His personality is exaggerated on the negative side, making him appear almost psychotically angry in the beginning and delusionally egotistical towards the end. He is also more blatantly abusive of the Rose Bride, treating her like a tool, and his love for her is never touched upon. His relationship with Touga is non-existent.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Not only can she change the appearance of her clothing and levitate (and, by extension, fly) as all full-fledged goddesses are expected to, but she can also teleport through mirrors, speak to and understand animals, \"see\" people's emotions as auras, heal minor wounds by speeding metabolism, and \"speak\" to machines. Furthermore, she is a superb cook, and her singing skills are held to be the best in the heavens. She is also incapable of getting drunk on alcoholic drinks, but instead gets drunk with soda (it has to be noted, however, that she's a complete lightweight in this regard. One sip is enough to send her in a drunken rampage\u2014although given her personality, \"rampage\" takes an entirely different, but no less destructive, meaning). In addition, she is also the top broom racer in heaven, the only one that could rival her is Welsper from hell or Hild the Daimakaichou herself.\n\r\nBelldandy's angel is Holy Bell (Bless\u9920Bell in some versions of the English manga); her elemental attribute is wind. Like all angels, Holy Bell augments Belldandy's magical powers when called upon, and like all angels, she also reflects her master's current state. For example, when Belldandy falls unconscious after being infected with a virus (in the movie), Holy Bell emerges comatose and covered with crystals that represent the virus.\n\r\nBelldandy does not appear to play a significant role in maintaining Yggdrasil. Rather, she works at the Goddess Relief Agency which deals with granting wishes (forming contracts) with humans, similar to Peorth's work at the Earth Assistance Agency.",

She was previously dating and in love with Zack Fair.\n\nShe is first introduced as a flower girl, and she briefly converses with Cloud Strife, a mercenary who is fleeing from the bombing of a Mako reactor by himself and AVALANCHE. The two later meet at the church in the Sector 5 slums, when he falls down from the plate and through the roof of the church. Later, when faced with the possibility of being captured by the Turks, the two join forces to escape. As he reminds her of Zack Fair, she asks him to be her bodyguard in return for one date. \n\nShe is eventually captured by Shinra and taken to the science lab, however Cloud and friends infiltrate the building and save her. She then joins them in the pursuit of Sephiroth, while embarking on a journey of self-discovery as well.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to foil Sephiroths theft of the Black Materia, she ventures alone into the Forgotten City for as yet unknown reasons. Cloud and his companions follow after her, eventually finding her praying at an altar. As she looks up to smile at Cloud, however, Sephiroth appears and kills her by impaling her through the torso. The materia given to her by her mother, which she wore in her hair, falls from the altar into the water and was lost. After fighting an incarnation of Jenova, Cloud carries her body out into a lake in the Forgotten City, and releases her back to the Planet.\n\nThe party later learns the reason for her being in the Forgotten City; through her mothers materia, now known as the 'White Materia', she was able to summon Holy, the ultimate White Magic, and the only force capable of repelling the ultimate Black Magic, Meteor. Even though she successfully managed to cast Holy before her death, it was held back by the sheer force of Sephiroths will. When he was finally defeated and Holy was released, it appears that it was too late to function as effectively as it should, for Meteor - already summoned by Sephiroth and set on a collision course with the Planet - had come too near the Planet's surface. \n\nWhile Holy clashes with Meteor, attempting to prevent its impact, the gravity of both Meteor and Holy pulling on the spell in opposite directions weakens it, leaving it with too little room to take effect. The Lifestream then flows forth from within the planet, intervening with Holy and Meteor, and acting as a battering ram while aiding in the destruction of Meteor. This scene is followed by a vision of Aerith within the Lifestreams energy.\n\nShe later makes several appearances in the CGI film, Final Fantasy VII Advent Children. As Cloud's spiritual guide, she urges him to move on in life, to forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control and to tell him that she never blamed him for her death. During several flashes, she speaks to Cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers, cheerfully and kindheartedly poking fun at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past, but also acknowledging his suffering and offering kind words of support.\n\nTowards the end of the movie, somehow she causes it to rain, the water curing the victims of the Geostigma when they come into contact with it. She is also seen at the church at the very end, watching Cloud, alongside Zack Fair.\n\nSource - Wikipedia",

After their parents died, Leon and Sophie abandoned their abusive relatives and sought a trapeze coach named Alain, who took the siblings under his wing and discovered their potential, as well as how they invented put of scrap the Angelic Act. He subjected both of them to an amazingly hard training (especially Sophie, who was the one with the strongest will to perform the act), but at mid-way Leon felt that Alain couldn't teach them anything and left with Sophie.\n\r\nDuring the last Circus Festival, Sophie was called by Yuri Killian asking her to meet him before the Festival at which she and Leon were two perform. However, this was a trap: Yuri never meant to meet with her, only wanting Sophie out of the way to cause the pair's forfeit and solidify his win with Layla. Just before the Festival began, however, Sophie tried to come back in time, only to be hit by a car when running across the street; she died in the hospital, with a crushed Leon next to her. Just before she died, Leon called Yuri and tearfully asked him to visit Sophie, trying to deny the rumors about him being the culprit; Yuri, however, knew that he couldn't just show up and didn't.\n\r\nSophie's death crushed Leon as he struggled with trying to fulfill his sister's dying wish: find and raise the true star in Sophie's place. For that, he subjects all of Sophie's \"successors\" (including May and Sora) to the same training Sophie went through, which is the cause of his \"God of Death\" nickname. He eventually realizes, when he meets Sora, that she is the one who can become his partner, perform the Angel Act and become the true star.\n\r\nIn the final chapter, Leon is paired up with Sora in the work \"The Swan Lake\", and after helping Sora perform the act with her, not only fulfills Sophie's wish, but also opens his heart to the idea of performing on a fun, conflict-free stage just like the one his sister dreamed of.\n\r\nIn the OVA The Amazing Princess Without a Smile, he tries to take up more comical roles on the Stage, playing one of the three Fools.",

    "description": "Tyki and his group suckers Arystar into a game of strip poker, winning literally all his assets, but Allen interferes and plays against them. He wins (with cheating learned from years spent with Cross), and Tyki gives him a pack of playing cards before his group departs.\n\r\nThe author gives the first hint that something is wrong when the group is revealed to have in their possession a chunk of silver with the name Kevin Yeegar on it - the name of the exorcist general that had recently been killed. In their next encounter, Allen meets Tyki's Noah side, and, after a talk, Tyki leaves him to die from a heart wound inflicted by Tease (a flesh-eating type of golem in the form of a butterfly) after destroying his Innocence, spreading out the same cards he had given Allen over the boy's body. After realizing that Allen's name would not come off the walls of the jail cell, he goes with Jasdero and Debit to find Cross.\n\r\nTyki's powers stem from his ability to selectively interact with his surroundings. This allows him to become effectively intangible, passing through all manner of matter as a ghost would, or walk on air.\n\r\nHis powers also have an offensive aspect, allowing him to phase his hand into his opponents' bodies and selectively interact with their organs (i.e. heart), crushing them or tearing them out without leaving any external wounds.\r\nHe also possesses the ability to reject the existence of space around an area he chooses, which essentially makes it possible for him to create a vacuum around anything he pleases (this ability was put to good effect against Allen, which allowed Tyki to suffocate him in their fight).\n\r\nHe usually attacks using his powers in concert with the flesh-eating Tease golems given to him by the Earl of Millennium. The Tease themselves are capable of multiplying themselves, becoming a large swarm to consume Tyki's enemies, or change shape to act as shields or throwing blades.\r\nHe was responsible for the death of Kevin Yeegar, one of the 5 exorcist generals, and has killed over 6 other exorcists himself, including Suman Dark (whom Allen had tried to save), Tina Spark, Gwen Frere, Sol Galen, Kazanna Reed, Chakar Rabon, and Daisya Barry.",

    "name": "Lavi ",
    "description": "Age: 19\r\nHeight: 177 cm (5'9\"), 179 cm (5'10\")\r\nWeight: 62 kg (136 lbs), 68 kg (150 lbs)\r\nHair color: Red\r\nEye color: Green\r\nBlood type: O\r\nNationality: Mixed Race\r\nRelatives: Bookman\r\nLikes: Yakiniku, sleeping, annoying Kanda Yuu\r\nDislikes: Wasabi\r\nInterests: Reading\r\nFirst appearance in anime: Episode 12\n\r\nA cheerful red-haired Exorcist of mixed race, who aims to become a Bookman and is working along the Black Order just to be close to the events that must be seen. To help him, he developed an incredible memory: he is able to memorize every single aspect of something he saw, but he commented (in chapter 101) that he could identify \"the key\" (the key which Tyki Mikk gave) faster if he were to use both his eyes when sieving out the real \"key\" from the fake. He is 18 years old, and normally uses his left eye while the right eye is covered by an eye-patch. His anti-Akuma weapon is a size-shifting hammer, which he calls Oozuchi Kozuchi (\u5927\u69cc\u5c0f\u69cc, lit. \"big hammer small hammer\") or Nyoibo. It can grow (\u6e80, man) or extend (\u4f38, shin). The weight increases with its size, but since Lavi is the conformer, the weight does not effect him; However, it does to everyone else. His hammer can also summon several \"judgments\" with kanji possibly representing the classical elements that can be used individually or combined. However, between some of the seals are question marks. This probably means that Lavi has some seals that he has yet to learn from his Innocence. His techniques so far, are:\r\n- Hi Ban: Gouka Kaijin (\u52ab\u706b\u7070\u71fc \u706b\u5224, lit. Fire Seal: Conflagration of Ash): using the fire seal to create a torrent of flames with the form of a snake;\r\n- Ten Ban: Raitei Kaiten (\u96f7\u9706\u56de\u5929 \u5929\u5224, lit. Heaven Seal: Thundering Lightning Whirling in the Skies): using the heaven seal to liberate an immense lightning;\r\n- Moku Ban: Tenchi Bankai (\u5929\u5730\u76e4\u56de \u6728\u5224, lit. Wood Seal: Roots Entwining Heaven and Earth): using the wood seal to control objects in nature;\r\n- Konbo Ban: Gouraiten (\u30b3\u30f3\u30dc\u5224 \u525b\u96f7\u5929, lit. Combo Seal: Strong Thunder of the Heavens): using both fire and heaven seals to create a huge snake of fire and iron. Also making a shield-like flame wall.\n\r\nIt was shown when Bookman told Lavi to use the wood seal to clear the clouds (Three Akuma were hiding behind the clouds). Lavi stated that he forgot he could use it to affect nature directly, and as he remembered it the question mark turned into a kanji that he used right away. If seen more carefully the kanji for the wood seal can be seen throughout the manga whenever Lavi summons his seals long before the use of the actual seal itself (e.g. during the use of the heaven seal). At the moment just before its first use the seal can be seen just behind Lavi's head and had never transformed from a question mark in the first place.\n\r\nThe marks of water and earth also appear among his seals. He likes to call Bookman \"Panda\" due to the thick black circles around his eyes; a converted Akuma \"Chomesuke\"; and Arystar Krory\"Kuro-chan\" in the anime and \"Kro-chan\" in the manga. He is the only character other than General Tiedoll to call Kanda by his given name (that name being Yuu, also translated as Y\u016b or Yuu), and apparently speaks to him outside of missions, a fact that was shown when he called Allen \"beansprout\" (moyashi), saying that if Kanda could call him that, Lavi could as well, as he is the same age as Kanda. He has a habit of teasing Allen, and deems himself as his big brother. A recurring gag in the series is Lavi's fondness for beautiful older women, whenever he sees a woman his type (Example: Eliade) he'll yell out \"Strike!\" with hearts in his eye.\n\nIn recent chapters (beginning with 114), Lavi was fighting an incarnation of his past created by Road in one of her dimensions. It was revealed that his name, Lavi, is just an alias (his 49th, to be exact). He had cast aside his old name and background to show his commitment to being a Bookman. It was also revealed that Lavi was once cold and indifferent to others, for a Bookman only lives to view and record history and that humans are nothing more than 'ink' on a page. However, over time Lavi's personality changed and he began to truly care about others, slowly casting aside his identity as a Bookman. When he thought that Allen was killed by Tyki Mikk, he tried to avenge Allen by attempting to kill Tyki himself.\n\r\nDuring his fight against his past incarnation, his 'heart' (current personality) was supposedly destroyed. This caused his past incarnation, under the control of Road, to emerge in his physical body and savagely attack Allen. Unwilling to hurt Lavi, Allen attacked Road but failed to harm her, as her current body was not her true form. Lavi's current self managed to resurface and suppress his past self. He then engulfed himself in a massive Hi-Ban to attack Road in the real world, while simultaneously stabbing her through the heart within her dimension, defeating her.\n\r\nIn recent chapters, after the appearance of Cross Marian to their aid, Lavi's status was unknown after falling into a 'hole' made by the Millennium Earl's flashy entrance. He attempted to lengthen his Innocence to save himself, but it shattered when Allen grabbed Lavi's Innocence in an effort to pull him up. Although he was apparently lost in the 'hole' in the Ark, he was shown to have been revived along with the rest of the 'lost' Exorcists on the Ark when the Ark was restored by Allen. He is now back at Black Order HQ waiting for his Innocence to be fixed. When Lulubell and her Akuma attack the HQ, he is unable to assist Allen as he cannot activate his (shattered) hammer. When the level four akuma attacked Komui and the others, he and Kanda both act as a distraction in order for Lenalee to quickly create her newly formed innocence.\r\nThere are many different translations of his name, such as Ravi, Rabi, Labi. But it is found in the D.gray-man Omake from episode 61 that the correct spelling is Lavi.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "Road Kamelot is the first Noah introduced in the D. Gray-man series, appearing to Allen, Lenalee, and Miranda in the Rewinding City arc. Despite looking as if she is in her early teens, Road is referred to as the oldest of the Noah. Road has an affinity for candies and blood, as well as a childlike enjoyment of birthday-reminiscent themes.\n\r\nRoad has a plethora of supernatural abilities, ranging from the ability to travel to an alternate dimension through a door that appears at her will to complete regeneration after injury. Her dimensional space is in the form of a wrapped present, while her weapons of choice are levitating candles that can be sharpened to waxen stakes. While inside her personal dimension, she can control nonliving objects within the area; For instance, her stake-like candles fly to attack at her will. She has absolute control of everything in her dimension ranging from her appearing out of the floor, creating a copy of Lavi to crumbling his Innocence. Outside of her dimension she has displayed Telekinetic powers.\n\r\nRoad's personality and home life are surprisingly normal, despite her role as a villain. She has a childlike need to be entertained at all times, usually by the Earl's parasol Lero, and forces Tyki to entertain her when Lero will not. She shows a tendency to procrastinate on schoolwork, like many children her age, and appears to be in trouble for skipping classes often. Despite her childlike tendencies, she has also shown signs of extreme sadism and seems to enjoy watching the suffering of others, including stabbing Allen through the eye, killing an Akuma subordinate for no other reason then to anger Allen, and nailing Miranda\u2019s hands to a clock while writing profanity on the wall in her blood.\n\r\nHer relationships with the other members of the Noah family all vary on a basis quite similar to a normal family situation; She looks up to Tyki as an older brother and is very close to him, while the twins appear to bicker with her often in a sibling-like, affectionate manner. Her relationship with Skin is unknown, as almost no interaction between the two is shown in the series. She also seems to have feelings for Allen Walker, as she kisses him upon seeing him again. Tyki finds this surprising, as the only one she kissed before was the Earl.\n\r\nDespite Road's young appearance, she is considered the First Child by Debit and Jasdero, which suggests that she was the first Noah to awaken in the current generation. Due to this fact, she is the only Noah capable of programming Noah's Ark, and appears to have the favoritism of the Millennium Earl. She represents Noah's \"Dreams\". Road's nationality is unknown.",

    "name": "Melissa Mao",
    "description": "Birthday: May 11, 1976\r\nBlood type: B\n\r\nServing as the SRT's second-in-command next to Gail McAllen, she serves in Mithril under the call sign Uruz-2. Her expertise in electronic warfare is valued by the Pacific Battle Group Tuatha de Danaan. Her rank was Sergeant Major, but by the novel Dancing Very Merry Christmas she has been promoted to Second Lieutenant, making her a commissioned officer.\n\r\nMelissa is very proficient in use of an Arm Slave, however she lacks exact control. She tends to use fast and furious methods in her firearm use. Later in the series she usually does not pilot an Arm Slave, but she can still pilot excellently, although her capabilities are nowhere near those of Sousuke Sagara and Kurz Weber. Aside from English, she can also speak fluent Cantonese due to her time spent in Hong Kong, particularly in Kowloon.\n\r\nMelissa is a ruthless insulter and an extremely heavy drinker, somewhat reminiscent of Misato Katsuragi from Neon Genesis Evangelion who is also voiced by Alison Keith. She is shown once having many cigarettes and a minimum of 20 beer cans sprawled out on Tessa's coffee table. She is extremely rude, preferring to use heavy language when talking to someone angering her or someone she cannot stand. During the Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu! episode in which Sousuke is training rugby players, he is shown using extremely heavy language based on the training manual Melissa gave him&mdash;language inspired and quoted from R. Lee Ermey's lines in Full Metal Jacket; appropriate, since Mao was a Marine Corps drill instructor. She also enjoys a practical joke or two. Once in the series when Sagara called to protest Tessa's staying in his apartment, she gave him permission to \"jump her bones,\" obviously aware of Tessa's feeling for him. But in the next episode when Tessa again found herself in his bedroom, Mao was there and she handcuffed Tessa to herself to keep her from sneaking into his room.\n\r\nBorn to Chinese-American parents in New York City, Melissa was brought up under strict Chinese traditions that included her supposed arranged marriage. When she realized it, she left home and immediately joined up with the United States Marine Corps, entering the recruitment office while still in her wedding gown. After several years of service, she was eventually given a dishonorable discharge. Up to now, Melissa has bitter feeling with her father, who had been in the United States Air Force.[9] After leaving the Marines, Melissa went to Hong Kong, then under British control, and stayed with some of her maternal relatives.\n\r\nScouted by MITHRIL, she was given the codename Urzu-2 by Gail McAllen and was given the command of her own team until two of her comrades were permanently injured while on active duty. Because of this, she was forced to head to MITHRIL's secret training camp in the forests of Berutarube in order to select her new replacements. Melissa was initially intrigued by Kurz Weber despite his poor marksmanship, but he was promptly taken off the list of potential candidates after Melissa experienced firsthand Kurz's womanizing attempts. Sousuke Sagara was not even considered one of Melissa's potential candidates, due to his low test scores and seemingly overall mediocrity. It was only by chance that Melissa noticed him during an AS simulation test. It was there that Sousuke skillfully piloted an RK-92 Savage and defeated an M6 operated by a top-scoring recruit.\n\r\nAfter the Berugan president had called MITHRIL personnel in Berutarube to rescue his kidnapped daughter, Maria, and eliminate a communist rebel cell, she was left with Sousuke, Kurz, and Jimmer after a first strike attempt had netted the capture of most of the MITHRIL instructors and recruits.\n\r\nRealizing that Sousuke and Kurz were hiding their skills from her, she forced them to come clean and ordered them to battle with the guerrillas, overpowering their ASs and forcing the rebels to surrender. She eventually decided to let Sousuke and Kurz enter her squad as the new members. Afterwards, she was sent into Tokyo with the rest of her squad to guard Kaname Chidori. Nearing the end of the first series, she was wounded by Gauron during AS combat at a U.S. chemical weapons disarmament facility on Berildaobu Island, Republic of Perio. Although she was mostly incapacitated, she managed to assist Kurz in killing Guen Bien Bo by tossing surgical scalpels into him, a skill that she did not show until near the end of the anime.\n\r\nMelissa is a friend to Tessa and as such, has access to her office.\n\r\nEarly on in her MITHRIL career, Mao was good friends with Gail McAllen and Belfangan Grouseax, both soldiers who later became commanding officers of Tuatha De Danaan's SRT unit. This friendship has helped her maintain a good working relationship with both men, although Grouseax asked her to hide his friendship with him and McAllen from the SRT troops.\n\r\nWith the heavy losses suffered by the Special Response Team in the defense of Merida Island, Mao has become the second in command of the SRT.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

You see, Kumiko is also the acting Koumichou, or head of the Ooedo Clan, a powerful yakuza group. Her grandfather Ryuichiro Kuroda, the Koumichou of the Ooedo and guardian of Kumiko since her parents' deaths, had fallen ill and now she has to fill-in for him. The group of hoods that often surrounds Kumiko (who addresses her as 'Ojou'), which includes Tetsu Asakura and Minoru Tatsuwaka, tend to be a bit overprotective of Kumiko, and she has to assert her authority over these lunks to keep them in line... especially when they heard the students made fun of her during her first day in class!\n\nKumiko is an excellent martial artist, which came in handy when she found out that a former student of the school, Hiroki Kudoh, had sneaked back in to beat-up the juniors of the school \u2013 which included Kuma. However, Kumiko has to be very careful not to let the secret that she is the Koumichou of the Ooedo slip. However, Shin suspects that there is something different about Kumiko, so she has to be careful around him.\n\n(Source: Absolute Anime)",

Later she, along with nine others, were branded with Orochimaru's first ten samples of the Cursed Seal of Heaven. Of the ten, Anko was the only one to survive, establishing the one-in-ten chance of surviving the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru supposedly rejected Anko as a subordinate, believing she did not have the lust for power or vengeance needed to fuel the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru lost interest in her, though he believed there was some value in letting her live. In the anime, after learning of her past, she was glad to discover that she wasn't tossed away like trash as she first had thought by Orochimaru, but chose to leave Orochimaru herself.\n\r\nAnko is easygoing, tomboyish, playful, stubborn, and sometimes hyperactive, making her very similar to Naruto Uzumaki in many ways. Despite portraying several \"Naruto-like\" habits, she has shown to be very knowledgeable and studious. \n\r\nHowever, she is also shown to have a bloodthirsty (in a literal sense) side, as shown when she scratched Naruto's face with a kunai, and licked away his blood. This probably comes from her time with Orochimaru. She regularly makes sure to have at least basic knowledge of the landscape for which her next mission will take place.\n\r\nAs shown in flashbacks during the Land of Sea arc, Anko greatly admired Orochimaru while under his tutelage, seeing him as a role model and was inspired to be more like him. After being branded by Orochimaru with the Curse Seal, Anko became enraged and carried a deep loathing for her former teacher. From there on, Anko continues to search for Orochimaru in hopes of taking him down, feeling that it is her duty as his former subordinate to stop him, even at the cost of her life.",

Afterwards, Ichise goes berserk and ends up getting his left leg cut off in similar fashion by Isshii.\n\nHe manages to get around with a crude crutch, but ends up giving up in despair after he continually has trouble with stairs. Oonishi, the leader of Organ, calls up Doc and tells her that Ichise might be a decent guinea pig for her research. With Doc's 'help', he gets a new Texhnolyzed arm and leg.\n\nAt first, he abhors his new limbs, but manages. He sees Isshii again and attempts to attack him, but is put down by Isshii's men. He is thrown into the sewers, but manages to escape with the help of Ran. He then spends some time practicing with his Texhnolyze to get the hang of it. He locates Isshii later and manages to beat the shit out of him.\n\nHe then walks around with Ran for awhile. He runs into Shinji, leader of Lakan, who invites him to Lakan's headquarters. There, he practices the sensitivity of his Texhnolyze. He then leaves and shows up again in the middle of a large confrontation between Organ, the Alliance, and Lakan, where he inadvertantly sets off the spark that starts the war. At the end of the battle, Oonishi brings him along where he eventually stops Yoshii from destroying Lux.\n\nOonishi then includes him as a temporary member of Organ and assigns him to work under Kohagura. He works alongside Touyama and captures Sakizaki, who stops Mizuno's half-assed plans of taking over Lux. He also discovers the people who framed his father and beats the shit out of them.\n\nAfter that, he becomes an official member of Organ. He helps uncover Gabe's factory that is mass-producing weapons and saves Oonishi's life when Mizuno tries to kill him. At that point, Ran tells him his future wherein he will destroy everyone and will end up all alone in the end. After getting some nice upgrades to his Texhnolyze courtesy of Doc, he helps Kohagura and Sonada escape from Tsujinaka's men, then kills Tsujinaka under Kohagura's orders. Afterwards, he is assigned to protect Goto when the Shapes make their appearance. He saves Goto from being killed and helps Organ fight back against the Shapes.\n\nOonishi then asks him to go and find Doc to help the wounded. After finally getting her to agree to come out, she tries to pull some lovey-dovey stuff on him and says that they should just go to Gabe and spend their lives together because the people of Lux are doomed. They then see Ran in the center of Lux and run into Oonishi and Shinji at the train station. Oonishi asks him to go with Doc to warn the people of Kanno's plan, but he refuses because he's worried about Ran. Oonishi tells him that his debt has been repaid so he is free to decide for himself what he will do.\n\nHe heads to the upper world with Doc. Upon getting there, he realizes that the Class is no different than Lux - everyone is just sitting around and waiting for death. He realizes the trip was pointless and heads back to Lux. Before he can get there, he runs into Touyama and is forced in a katana duel, which he wins. He also meets with his deceased father and apologizes for how badly he had thought of him through the years when his hatred should have been placed on the thugs that framed him.\n\nHe eventually makes it back to Lux only to find out that no Texhnolyze works anymore. He meets Goto who tells him that it's pointless to head back into the city. He goes there, anyway. He meets with Ran and tells her that he wants to bring her to the upper world where there is no fighting. He tells her that he believes he is her guardian angel and that's why he came back.\n\nHe watches as Oonishi is annihilated by the men of Lux, at which point he goes berserker and beats the hell out of them all as he regains partial control of his Texhnolyze with Doc's help. He heads for the Opera House to find Kanno and, consequently, Ran. When he asks about Ran, he gets a long-winded story about Kanno's motives.\n\nHe eventually finds out that Ran has been Shaped and that her 'spirit' has been killed and she basically has no more consciousness. He is mighty miffed that Kanno did this and, despite knowing that Kanno is the life-blood of the Lux, lops his head of with a powerful fist to the face.\n\nHe returns what's left of Ran to the place where the Elder's body was finally laid to rest and finds exile in a building on the outskirts of the city. He glances over the city one last time, then rolls over to his side and watches his Texhnolyze arm play a crude, line-art of Ran's flower. He closes his eyes, smiles, and the world around him, and eventually he, fades away.\n(Source: somehow-someday.com/texhnolyze)",

    "name": "Souichirou Nagi",
    "description": "Birthday: May 8th\r\nHeight: 165 cm\r\nWeight: 58 kg\r\nMother: Makiko Nagi\r\nFather: Kago Souhaku\n\r\nSouichirou is a brash, blonde, spiky haired teenager, who enjoys fighting. As a child, Souichirou was bullied and tormented because his family consists of demon exorcists, and were not well liked as a result. The apartment he shared with his mom was also covered in offensive messages. Souichirou started fighting early as a result, beating up those who tormented him. In elementary school, he met up with his best friend Bob Makihara, and they started calling themselves the Knuckle Bombs. The pair go to school beating up everyone they find until they have been proven the strongest. Upon arriving at Todo Academy, Souichirou quickly learns he is nowhere near as strong as he thought.\n\r\nSouichirou fights using street fighting methods as opposed to real martial arts. He prides himself on being a thug and therefore he fights without honor, usually with cheap shots, etc... However, he does seem to draw line when it comes to hitting women. After training with Maya Natsume, he learns more martial arts moves including the Forged Needle attack. Throughout the Manga, it is shown that Souichirou and Aya Natsume have some sort of mental connection between them that calls to the other when they are in trouble.\n\r\nSouichirou is a teen obsessed with fighting and takes a lot of pride in that. Ironically, he believes that fighting doesn't resolve anything, and fights more for fun than anything else. Initially, he is believed to have an average, or below average intelligence. He is very cocky and gets angered easily, and always has wise cracks. He isn't very good with being around girls, because he had little contact with them up until high school because they thought he was creepy. When he enrolled into Todo Academy, he fought Masataka Takayanagi resulting in him losing his first major fight. He falls in love with Maya Natsume, because she is similar to him. Through out the series, he repeatedly has shown he has trouble showing any affection towards people he cares about. Souichirou is slowly changing, and starting to become more intelligent and starting to build the charisma of a leader. For example, Souichirou actually gets Kagesada Sugano (almost solely referred to by his nickname asshat in the manga or scum in the anime) to once again become an active Juken Club member. Their initial encounter seems to inspire Kagesada to quit his typical cowardly behavior and fight. Souichirou also occasionally breaks the fourth wall. The two most notable instances of this are in chapter 3 when he states that he's supposed to be the \"hero,\" and in episode 24 of the anime when he refers to Masataka as a secondary character.\n\r\nAya is in love with him, but he seems uninterested because he is in love with Maya, although later on in the series he shows signs of liking or possibly loving her, not reacting so drastically when Aya shows her affections and trying to protect or comfort her (such as in chapter 109 when Souichirou, after Aya's fight with Hirohiko, goes to check on her because he is worried about her even though he won't admit it, which ends up in him receiving a kiss from her outside of the shower where they first met). Maya's feelings for Souichirou are unknown. Later on, Shizuru Kamura, she also develops a crush on Souichirou and views Maya as an enemy as a result. Soichiro also seems to be rather protective of his mother, even though it doesn't seem so initially. He plans to drop out and take over her work so she can finally retire after he competes in this years tournament.",

    "name": "Masataka Takayanagi",
    "description": "Birthday: November 23\r\nZodiac: Scorpio\r\nClass: 2nd year student of Todo Academy\r\nKnown relatives: Takayanagi Dougen (father), Takayanagi Mitsuomi (brother)\n\r\nHe is the younger brother of Mitsuomi Takayanagi, but the two aren't on good terms. Masataka is your average high school student at first glance, but he is a surprisingly powerful martial artist. He is always a formidable fighter, but he becomes much more dangerous when he is serious or angered. He actually is easygoing and somewhat shy; however, his inner nature is perverted, even though he dislikes this part of himself. Masataka falls in love with Aya Natsume at first sight, but is disheartened when she falls in love with Souichiro Nagi instead. He has maintained a crush on her, yet is oblivious to the other girls who have a crush on him. After the incident at the bowling alley, he is greeted by some blushing girls from Todo Academy, he is seemly ignorant of their intentions.\n\r\nAya describes him as the calm surface that gently envelops the rapids.\n\r\nMasataka is set up early as a great fighter, but is later ignored. At one point in the OVAs, S\u014dichir\u014d refers to him as a supporting character. Despite being a great fighter, and one of the more powerful characters, Masataka is one of the most poorly treated characters. Because his elder brother is the president of the executive council, Masataka purposely joins the opposing Juken club.\n\r\nSoon after he meets Aya for the first time and falls in love with her, Masataka and Maya Natsume come across Bob Makihara and Souichirou. Bob is amazed someone can make Souichirou seem so helpless in a one on one fight, as Masataka beats up on Souichirou. Angered by this, Masataka says for the first time he actually feels like beating up Souichirou, and does another KI attack. Souichirou distracts him by using his \"barrier,\" where he shoves the unwanted bento Aya made for him in Masataka's face. Masataka attacks Souichirou in a berserker rage who gives him a severe beating.\n\nLater in the series, for a while Masataka's only relevance was telling Bob what to do for training, but as Bob gets better he starts having sparring sessions with Masataka. As Bob starts to lose in his fight against the sword expert, Madoka Mawari, Masataka steps up and takes the fight for him. In his first move he actually places his hand on Bob's shoulder and blasts KI through him. A good display of Masataka's skill as Bob was uninjured by this. Masataka actually gets serious in this fight, saying he is angry \"for the first time in a long time.\" This is when it is revealed he is an anti-weapons specialist. After defeating Madoka, and her subsequent release from Sohaku's manipulation jutsu, she falls in love with Masataka although he doesn't notice.\n\r\nMasataka was sitting on the curb with some others waiting to see how things turned out, as his brother and Maya went to rescue Souichiro from Sohaku. Now the tournament has finally started. Masataka's faith is placed correctly in Kagesada, as he defeats nearly the entire Jujutsu club himself. When the newly enhanced captain of the Jujutsu club arrives, Masataka notices she's fighting way different than she should be. She displays crude and brutish skill. Masataka notes she is renowned for having the most beautiful form in the school. He knows there is no way she should be fighting like that, but it doesn't seem he understands why she is. In the end the fight ends up a double KO so the Juken club wins the round.\n\r\nLater on, after hearing that his brother was fighting Bunshichi, Masataka storms the estate in order to stop the fight only to arrive too late. Mitsuomi, (who is still holding a seemingly dead Bunshichi) looks up to find a furious yet saddened Masataka. Before the battle ensues it is said by Hirohiko Myoun Kabane the third god, Tsukuyomi, is to revealed with the conclusion of this fight. Tsukuyomi is said to be the embodied spirit of the moon. The two then begin to fight, and after a volley of devastating blows Masataka lands an elbow strike on his brother with enough force that he is blasted away, blood churtling from his mouth. Mitsuomi is stunned at his brother's progress. Souichirou becomes Susanou, walking up to the floor where everyone is. After Mitsuomi challenge Souichirou, Masataka sits in the chair where Mitsuomi usually sits as the head of the Takayanagi clan, challenging Souichirou, not Susanou to a fight. He also announces that he wants to be the strongest. He promise him that he will be strong and face him in battle.\n\r\nIn the battle versus Souichirou, Masataka is able to keep up with him in the beginning stages, but after a few attacks, he is heavily beaten (including a permanent scar across his face and his right hand and forearm being sliced by S\u014dichir\u014d's aura alone); however, he does not give up, landing at least one more blow full of KI which allows Aya and Maya (within Souichirou's soul) to push Reiki into Sohaku, negating his powers. He becomes the new president of the executive council and has replaced his right hand with one of Mataza's mechanical arms. The entire club thanks the now deceased Maya (who saved Souichirou from being taken over by his anger and negating his power completely) as things go back to what they once were.\r\nTechniques\nUraate (\u88cf\u5f53\u3066 lit. Backing/Reverse Strike): This is a fulcrum-based transference skill, an example of KI transmission that teaches one to shift the point and force of impact by striking the dead center of an object. At expert-levels, a practitioner can transmit the force of impact wherever they please, as long as a medium exists to transmit their power through. This technique forms the basis for most KI-based techniques used throughout the series.\n\r\nRyuukei Qigong Tashinkou (\u9f8d\u5f62\u6c17\u529f\u935b\u91dd\u529f lit. Dragon Qi, Forged Iron Needle): This technique is the greatest of secrets within the Takayanagi clan, passed down for generations. It is a technique which uses the fulcrum-based transference skill of Uraate to transmit the user's power through the air. This is achieved by collecting the rotational force of one's motion until it forms unto a needle, forged by their own KI. At that point, that collected atmospheric force would then be directed from the circular motion into a straight line (via punch), where it is sent barreling into the target.\n\r\nHakka Soudou Shou (\u516b\u639b\u53cc\u649e\u638c lit. Eight Triagrams Double Pulsating Palms/Eight-Way Fracas Blast): A move that uses the palms to transfer momentum from the fighter to opponent in one fierce action, normally yielding incredible force. In the original Japanese translation, Souichiro comically refers to it as a Kamehameha, the signature technique of Dragon Ball's Son Goku.\n\r\nShin'irikugou Bateihouken (\u5fc3\u610f\u516d\u5408 \u2022 \u99ac\u8e44\u5d29\u62f3 lit. Heart & Mind, Six Harmonies: Trampling Horse Fist/Cosmic Thundering Horse Hoof Death Attack): This is a Beng Quan horse move (\u99ac\u5f62; pinyin: m\u01ce x\u00edng) throwing a punch from the drawn-arrow stance. The martial artist delivers an overhead smash, digging into the heart with wrist bent and elbow facing downward. The end result can lead to cardiac arrest from blunt trauma to the heart. Masataka was interrupted during his attempt on Souichiro. Allegedly, Japanese master Kenichi Sawai was fond of this technique.\n\r\nShin'irikugou Taihoutenshi Tsuuhaiken (\u5fc3\u610f\u516d\u5408 \u2022 \u5927\u9d6c\u5c55\u7fc5\u901a\u80cc\u62f3 lit. Heart & Mind, Six Harmonies: Giant Phoenix Spreading Wings Over Back Fist/Heart & Earth, Giant Bird Wings Through Back Fist): This KI-based technique is fundamentally similar to the \"Ryukei Qigong Tashinkou,\" but the martial artist transmits their KI through a solid medium (such as a tree, a concrete construct or even a living being) rather than air.\n\r\nHakkashou Juushichishiki Kandouka (\u516b\u639b\u638c\u5341\u4e03\u5f0f\u8cab\u9285\u82b1 lit. Eight Binding Palms, 17th Variation Piercing Bronze Flower): A move that can pierce iron with the softness of a flower.\n\r\nShin'irikugou Kongoutaihou (\u5fc3\u610f\u516d\u5408\u91d1\u525b\u4f53\u6cd5 lit. Heart & Mind, Six Harmonies: Tempered Diamond Body): A secret Chinese martial arts technique that enables the body to become as solid as diamond. It works by instantaneously concentrating the water in one's body to a certain area, since the strongest water pressure can stop even bullets. Masataka used this technique, stopping two of Emi Isuzu's anki, one with his palm and one with his forearm.",

    "description": "Homeland: Tokyo, Japan\r\nFamily: Takamura Suguru (older brother), Takamura Kyouka (older sister), Takamura Wataru (little brother)\r\nOccupation: Professional Boxer\r\nWeight Class: Middleweight (Currently), Junior Middleweight\r\nHeight: 185 cm (6'1\")\r\nReach: 189 cm (74\")\r\nStyle: Hybrid\r\nStance(s): Orthodox Stance, Brawling Stance, Hitman Style\r\nCurrent Affiliation: Kamogawa Boxing Gym\r\nTrainer: Kamogawa Genji\n\r\nHe is a multi-weight class (currently middleweight) hybrid boxer affiliated with the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. He is the current unified WBC and WBA Middleweight champion and strongest known character in the series.\n\r\nTakamura is very hearty, rude and often behaves vulgarly. He is a loud arrogant boaster who tends to refer to himself as Ore-sama (a Japanese name suffix intended for people of great importance) and he rarely ever shows a shred of consideration towards other fighters after a loss.\n\r\nTakamura was discovered on the streets by Coach Kamogawa Genji, and his speed, power, and technique are all high-level to the point that he is capable of handling both In Fighters and Out Boxers without too much trouble. Unlike most characters in Hajime no Ippo, he has no special finishing blow, but every punch he has possesses killer destructive power. With the wild power to always force out any situation he claims will happen, he is a man who does everything he says he will.\n\r\nAs the one who got Ippo, Aoki and Kimura into boxing, he is well respected at the Kamogawa Gym. Even though he constantly looks down on and ridicules their achievements, his unrivalled strength and the few moments his true kindness leaks out prevent them from losing their respect for him. Takamura loves to pick on his fellow gym mates, with Aoki usually the first on his list. Although he tends to get more serious when hearing about or training for his next match, he still finds the time to play pranks on everyone and goof around.\n\r\nHe is the current WBC and WBA World Middleweight Champion and former WBC Junior Middleweight Champion. He was also the JBC Middleweight Champion, but relinquished it after 4 title defenses. He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his Belts. He still lives there even after becoming World Champion, preferring a simple life.\n\nTakamura's one weakness is his arrogance and temper, as he is able to be easily provoked by many of his opponents, he also has in two occasions felt the compulsive need to finish his fights with 1-Hit KOs (Due to Miyata getting too much attention, and Ippo scoring a 1-Hit KO), which led to him almost losing against opponents a lot weaker than him.\n\r\nLike Miyata, Takamura is constantly struggling with weight control, so he is prone to losing stamina slightly quicker due to fighting in weight-classes below his natural weight. Aside from that the only times Takamura has been in trouble is when an opponent reads his attacks, but he just keeps trying until he finds a way to connect.\n\r\nIn both his matches with Eagle and Bison, Takamura's right eye (or at least his field of vision on his right side) played a key role in his opponents gaining the upper hand. This suggests he may have a detached retina in his right eye, though this is not confirmed by the manga.\r\nThe character for Taka (\u9df9) in his name means hawk, and as a result he is sometimes nicknamed The Japanese Hawk by announcers and spectators (most notably during his matches against Brian Hawk and David Eagle). He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his boxing belts. His pompadour hairstyle is his trademark.\n\r\nCurrent Record:\nRank: C (WBC), C (WBA)\r\nTotal fights: 24\r\nWins: 24\r\nWins by KO: 24\r\nLosses: 0\r\nDraws: 0",

    "name": "Masaru Aoki",
    "description": "Homeland: Tokyo, Japan\r\nOccupation: Chuuka Soba chef\r\nWeight class: Lightweight\r\nHeight: 171 cm (5'7\")\r\nReach: 171 cm (67\")\r\nStyle: Unorthodox boxing style\r\nStance: Orthodox Stance\r\nCurrent affiliation: Kamogawa Boxing Gym\r\nTrainer: Shinoda\n\r\nHe is an unorthodox lightweight boxer and one of the core members of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. He, along with Kimura Tatsuya, are known to have been scouted into boxing by Takamura Mamoru, an individual they swore to defeat but eventually came to admire.\n\r\nAoki was a punk from his childhood up through high school, at which point he encountered, fought and got beat down by Takamura Mamoru (who was then a middleweight with two wins under his belt). This loss motivated him to quit school along with his close friend Kimura Tetsuya to become boxers at Kamogawa gym. Although their initial goal was to land a clean hit on Takamura, they grew to love boxing and develop their own skills. Aoki became a clownish boxer whose signature techniques, the Frog Punch and Look-Away, eventually led him to a draw in a Japanese title match with then-champion Imae Katsuka. Currently in the series, Aoki had a going rivalry with Papaya Dachiu, the lightweight champion of the Philippnes, with whom he has drawn two consecutive matches.\n\r\nIn a flashback shown in the series, Aoki is known for his troubled school life as a delinquent. He, along with long-time friend Kimura, were known to participate in countless fights and brawls with 'rival' schools. Throughout the series Aoki has shown a rather playful, immature, and mischievous personality- an attitude he reflects in his boxing matches where (due to his comparatively unexceptional boxing skills) he constantly thinks of methods to to deceive, confuse, or even ridicule opponents to a certain extent. A very long-running gag is that Aoki keeps revealing impressing talents, that sadly have no connection with boxing. Another one involves his girlfriend's friendship with Kumi that has made made contacting her far more easy than Ippo could ever hope, so Aoki often helps him out. His prankster personality extends to his own teammates and is most notably reflected in his attitude towards Makunouchi Ippo and (at times) Takamura Mamoru. Together with Kimura he is paired into the Aokimura duo by Itagaki Manabu.\n\r\nAoki's taste in women is seen as a running joke in the Hajime no Ippo series where, in contrast to the tastes of his gym mates, Aoki places his preferences in women considered 'ugly' by everyone else. This may be due to an incident where he was cruelly dumped by a beautiful girl, psychologically turning him to prefer uglier girls. Even though he may have a taste for \"ugly\" girls, he is able to hold a girlfriend, Tomiko, longer then any of the other guys with the exception of Ippo but it remains to be seen if he and Kumi will ultimately be together.\n\nFor the most part Aoki's fights in the series are not as major or impactive on the general storyline. However, in his most recent fight against Iga Shinobu (and his coach Kurita Baron, a former member of the Kamogawa Gym), Aoki was beaten badly and landed himself in the hospital. Given the option to retire with Kimura after their considerably lengthy careers Aoki refuses, and is determined then to stay in the lightweight class until he defeats Iga, whom he now considers his goal and rival. Takamura is then seen commenting on how stubborn both Aoki and Kimura are.\nCurrent Record\nRank5 (JBC)\r\nTotal fights: 23\r\nWins: 12\r\nWins by ko: 7\r\nLosses: 8\r\nDraws: 3",

He is the smooth, collected type and a romantic at heart, but trains as hard as anyone. His style incorporates a fast left and faster footwork. In the past, he and Aoki were the toughest high-school thugs around, but now Tatsuya's real job is at his family's flower shop. He is a junior lightweight boxer. Along with Makunouchi Ippo, Takamura Mamoru, Aoki Masaru, and Itagaki Manabu, he rounds out the core members of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. His main fights in the series are against Mashiba Ryou and Eleki Battery.\n\r\nKimura and Aoki Masaru were best friends since kindergarten. In high school they began brawling and causing trouble with students from rival schools, namely North High, which eventually led to their expulsion. Kimura was the most affected by this because he was worried he had disappointed his mother. One day the pair attacked North High's Takamura Mamoru and lost miserably. Seeing Takamura's strength as a boxer, they decided to join the Kamogawa Boxing Gym to try and become strong too.\n\r\nKimura became a delincuent beacuse he was bullied by an older boy, and when his father went to confront the boy's father, he was pressured and ended up apologizing, this made Kimura lose all respect for his father, becoming more violent in both his house and in the outside, and decided to quit highschool without his parents knowing.\n\r\nLike Aoki, his boxing ability is also downplayed for much of the series (albeit not quite as badly). Despite this, he has proven to be a good boxer with solid all-around ability. Miyata stated that as a boxer, Kimura had no weaknesses (despite also not having any strengths) and Miyata's father said that although he was only ranked third before his fight with Mashiba, his talent surpassed that ranking. Mashiba himself admitted that Kimura was his strongest challenger. He shows strength around the level of a national champion, as he was able to draw with Eleki Battery twice and only barely lost to Mashiba.\n\r\nAs fast outboxer, Kimura is often asked to be a sparring partner for as Makunouchi and one time for Miyata, though Kimura benefited more from Miyata's sparring.\n\nAfter losing to Ryo Mashiba, he announced his retirement from boxing.Shortly after, unable to stay away from boxing, he returned saying he would spell his name in katakana (\u30bf\u30c4\u30e4) instead of kanji (\u9054\u4e5f).\n\nKimura's main role in the story is that of a supporting character, but upon his and Aoki's second entry into the Class A Tournament, they became directly antagonized by Iga Shinobu and his trainer, Baron Kurita. They are now both aiming to settle their grudge with the duo.\n\nCurrent Record\nTotal Fights: 24\r\nWins:15\r\nWins by KO:9\r\nLosses:6\r\nDraws:3",

    "name": "Haji ",
    "description": "He is partly instrumental in Saya's \"awakening\" and his right arm is covered in bandages, hiding some Chiropteran features that he is unable to change back into human form. This might be due to trauma when Saya sliced his hand during the Vietnam incident. Haji first met Saya when he was a child of age 12 and was brought by Joel to be her companion and hopefully mate and create more specimens someday. At this time Saya was 43 although she doesn't appear to be since she stopped aging in 1863. He lived with her in Joel's mansion for many years. But one day he fell from a cliff in an attempt to pick a flower that Saya wanted as a present for Joel's birthday. Seeing him bleeding everywhere and not really understanding that people don't drink blood to remain healthy, Saya gave him her own blood. Thus she unwittingly turned him into her \"Chevalier.\"\n\r\nSince then, Haji's single wish is to protect Saya and fulfill her wishes. It is also revealed that unlike Saya who \"created\" him, Haji neither eats, sleeps, nor goes into long periods of hibernation.\n\nHaji is Saya's first, and only living, chevalier. In 1870, the twelve year old boy is purchased by Joel and Amshel from his parents for a loaf of bread to be a companion for Saya, with hopes that they might mate and create more specimens for future experimentation. Haji lives with her in Joel's mansion for many years, he growing up but she never aging. In 1883, he falls from a cliff attempting to pick a flower that Saya wants as a present for Joel's birthday. Misunderstanding an earlier conversation between Haji and Joel about why Saya lives on blood, and wanting to save him, Saya feeds him some of her blood, unwittingly turning him into a chevalier. Saya feels some guilt over this through the years, but when she apologizes, Haji assures her that he has no regrets as it allows him to always be at her side while she lives her dream of traveling the world with her sword.\n\r\nHaji plays the cello, a skill he learned from Saya. He usually carries his cello in a large black case that he can also use as a blunt weapon and a shield, and the case also holds Saya's sword. Haji also fights with a handful of silver daggers that he keeps on hand. As with most chevaliers, Haji doesn't need to eat or sleep, and he stays awake while Saya eats, sleeps, or goes into long periods of hibernation. Unlike Diva's chevaliers, Haji never makes a full transformation into a chiropteran form; however, this is by his own choice rather than a limitation of his power. He keeps his right hand bandaged most of the time to hide the fact that its form is permanently chiropractic since Saya injured it while going crazy from being forced awake decades ago in Vietnam. In the opening credits of the final season, Haji is shown with wings, but he does not use them in the series until the forty-third episode. \n\r\nAfter Diva's death, Haji convinces Saya to live, confessing that he has always loved her. Agreeing that she does wish to live, Saya kisses him. As they, along with Kai and the rest of the Red Shield operatives, try to escape the opera house, Amshel attacks them, ripping off one of Haji's arms. Saya reloads her sword with blood and is ready to fight him to protect Diva's babies. However, Haji takes her sword and pushes her aside so she can escape while he impales Amshel himself. As Amshel crystallizes, he stabs Haji through the chest and the ceiling collapses on them both. Saya screams his name before they leave. She believes he may be dead, but Kai reassures her that Haji will return. Sometime after Saya goes into her hibernation, Kai brings Diva's daughters to visit the Miyagusuku crypt where Saya is sleeping. When they arrive, they find a fresh pink rose with Haji's blue hair ribbon tied to it.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "He was introduced to Diva by Amshel in 1917 during the Russian Revolution. At this point he agrees to become a chevalier as he wanted to free himself from seeing humans kill each other, and hoped that peace would prevail. But afterwards, he started seeing humans as insignificant and beneath him. Though as time passed, he realized the world of the chiropterans is just as full of war as the human one. Because he was wearing white at the time, it is the only color that Solomon wears as it is a symbol of him being Diva's chevalier.\n\r\nSolomon is of French descent and one of the most charming characters in the series. Owning handsome attributes like a kind, gentle smile, he is shown to be the eye-catcher of every woman in any gathering. Retaining the appearance of a young man in his early to mid-20s, he has pale skin, light green eyes, and wavy pale blond hair. His ever smiling face displays his peaceful nature. However, his eyes turn glowing red whenever he gets serious and fights using his chiropteran abilities while in human form.\n\nDuring Saya's fight with James, as she is about to be killed by James with her own sword, Solomon rushes to the scene and stops the attack. He declares that he has formed a bond that is stronger and sweeter than anything; a bond beyond blood and promises that he will always be Saya's chevalier whether he is rewarded or not. Unable to turn into a chiropteran as James notes, Solomon is able to partially transform his arm and injure James enough to let go of Saya's Sword which falls and cuts his shoulder. He further tries to protect her only in vain as he is knocked back by a swing of James' arm. After his brother's death, he kneels before Saya, telling her that should she ever need him, to call his name and he'll be there and leaves. As Saya tries to call out to him, he is already gone and Hagi tells her that Solomon formed a bond beyond blood out of love for her. In an alley, he begins to crystallize. Yet when Amshel shows up, he attempts to attack him but fails as he shatters while his brother watches, commenting on his foolishness. It is unknown as to whether Saya ever learned of his death as no one is shown telling her.\r\n(Source: Blood+ Wikia)",

Realizing the high risk of being a detective, Satoru formerly married Kyu's mother in secret to keep his new family safe. After Renjou's death, Kyu's mother hid the truth from Kyu for years, trying to shield him from the danger that the life of a detective is always in; after he was accepted in the DDS, Mrs. Renjou changed her mind and supported him fully.

He has a cunning, goal-oriented mind and does not seem to care what means he uses to accomplish those goals. His sense of morals is lax at best, but he is quick to find the moral flaws of others, which he keeps recorded in his \"Book of Threats\" or \"Devil's Handbook,\" and uses this information to blackmail everyone from students to figures of authority into placing him in a position of power. He has little respect for authority and has in fact usurped authority over Deimon High School well before the series begins and know authority of a vice principal, using his power in the school to give himself beyond-perfect scores in all his classes and divert funds to the American football club as he desires. Besides blackmail, Hiruma can often intimidate others into taking the action he wants by waving around his vast arsenal of firearms. Even without having to take direct action, Hiruma's mere reputation is enough in some instances to make the majority of the student body fear him and bow to his authority. \n\r\nDespite his penchant for blackmail and breaking seemingly every school rule without consequence, Hiruma adheres to the rules of American football without exception while playing. Inagaki says that Hiruma \"does everything else to win\" and is \"only concerned with winning.\" Instead, Hiruma attempts to throw opposing teams off guard through taunts and insults. Even when Hiruma expresses excitement or happiness, he does so in a violent manner, by firing his large guns into the air or kicking a teammate in the rear when they have executed well on a play. \n\r\nHe addresses all members of the Deimon Devil Bats with a vulgar manner, beginning with \"Fucking\" and ending with a descriptive noun, such as \"Shorty\" for Sena or \"Monkey\" for Monta. Some characters, such as Kid, have observed that Hiruma's attitude and even aspects of his demonic appearance are an act to intimidate his opponents both on and off the field. Over time, the series has alluded to Hiruma's 'true' personality, which Sena and Mamori Anezaki have at times been shown to understand to some degree, as when one or the other correctly observes Hiruma to be worried, happy, or tired. In addition to these instances, Hiruma has shown compassion to others, though he continues to hide it with his demonic behavior \u2014allowing Takami some privacy after a loss is one such instance. In addition, some of Hiruma's actions imply that he cares for the other members of the team more than he lets on. \n\nIn the case of his two oldest teammates, Hiruma abandoned Shinryuuji High to join Kurita at Deimon High when Kurita failed to gain entrance into the school, and he forbid Musashi's kicking tee from being touched after Musashi had to leave the team, making it an almost sacred object in the Devil Bats' locker room. As the series progresses, Hiruma's feelings for his teammates become more apparent, especially the faith he places in Sena and Monta. \r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Kurita lives in a temple with his father, who is the director of a Buddhist sect. His father believed that to grow up big and strong, a young boy had to eat a lot, but unfortunately it seems he has overfed his son. Kurita, as his name would suggest, has a head shaped like a chestnut. He is a very sweet, kind-hearted individual and the only thing bigger than his body is his heart. He became Sena's second friend after entering Deimon High School. When playing, Kurita shouts his kiai \"Funnuraba!\" when exerting extra effort. Before coming to Deimon, he attended the Shinryuji school, but was forced out because Kongo Agon was chosen over him for the special athletic scholarship, so he came to Deimon High along with Hiruma and Musashi. Like Hiruma. Kurita is crazy about American football and tries to encourage everyone to join though he does not go to the same extremes as his demonic compatriot. He can get so worked up that he's been known to begin morning practice as early as 2:00 AM. \n\nHis \"apprentice\" is Komusubi, who practices with him whenever he can. His biggest dream is to compete in the Christmas Bowl. He is somewhat dim-witted (nearly giving away Sena's other identity) and is insanely strong (he accidentally destroyed a small truck by hugging it). Also, whenever fights ensue, between the Deimon members, he always stops them by flattening all of them. Though he normally looks rather comical, he's dangerous when he's actually fired up. When Musashi rejoins the team, Kurita's \"alternate personality\" is revealed during the games. Kurita's face changes as his eyes inflame and become bigger, his eyebrows thicken, and his face tightens up. He gains even more strength than usual in this \"form\" (although he can quickly change back when he gets happy, but change back again as the game resumes). \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

His given name of Daikichi means 'Good Fortune.' His father named him after he had gotten a promotion after his son's birth. Though Daikichi is not very fast nor tall, but he makes up for it with his indomitable will and power. He decided to join the Devil Bats after seeing the Zokugaku exhibition match. Daikichi was highly impressed by Kurita's amazing strength and build, and decided that he wanted to become Kurita's \"apprentice\". He was able to join the team after surviving the Hell Tower qualifying test, beating out the Ha-Ha Brothers. Komusubi has taken to bunking at Kurita's house, and joining Kurita in waking up as early as 2AM to go training. He does not talk much, and apparently speaks (and writes) only in the language of Powerful-go that only \"true men\" can understand, which consists of strange grunts and one-word sentences. It is still confusing as to how people like Komusubi's father, Kurita, Deimon's gym teacher, Mizumachi, Gaou, and some of the members of the Nasa Aliens team, can comprehend what he is saying. (It should be noted that Mamori seems to be able to understand him as well). \n\nHe always seems to be the thorn in the side of the Ha-Ha Brothers, showing them that he's stronger than them and spurring them on to become stronger. He has also been shown lifting around 20 high-schoolers at once. Though they hate each other, Hiruma knows that their rivalry is what really drives them to become better players. He is also has a gifted talent for being a sumo. \n\nHe does not like to be teased about his small stature and does his best to prove that size is not everything. Komusubi is short like his mother, but he inherited his father's strength. He learns all on his own how to deal with taller opponents, which greatly helps in the game against Poseidon. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She is grumpy, unsocial, and views her classmates as idiots and freaks, citing that it is obvious that Chachamaru and Mana don't belong in the school and that 10-year-old Negi teaching the class does not make any sense. However, as much as Chisame avoids any and all attention in the real world, in the privacy of her own room, she takes on the persona of Chiu, a famous Net Idol, devoted to cosplay. Although she is, fitting with her character, rather disturbed by the idea of other students being openly attracted to and/or in love with 10-year-old Negi, she eventually becomes very close with Negi as he convinces her to interact with the real world. After finding out about the existence of magic, she reluctantly becomes part of Negi's group.\n\r\nChisame is an extremely skilled with computers, and she is able to hack into large databases with minimal effort. After forming a pactio with Negi, she gains the artifact, Sceptrum Virtuale, a heart-topped staff that allows her to actually enter cyberspace as a physical realm, upon which she can internally hack into systems.

However, her Pactio ability has the drawback of being near-useless when not connected to the internet, and her spirits disappear when her laptop's batteries are exhausted. Her Pactio has an additional ability which she uses more often, which allows her to transform into various Net-idol cosplay outfits.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "Jersey: 80\r\n40 yard dash: 5.0 (as of the start of the Kantou tournament)\r\nBirthday: August 31\n\r\nMonta is the wide receiver of the Deimon Devil Bats American football team. He resembles an ape, particularly a chimpanzee, in many ways; indeed, his simian similarity is the character's running joke throughout the manga. Although he is as short as Sena, his large hands, arms (that are noticeably longer than his legs), acrobatic moves, and leaping ability make him a very effective receiver; he can even catch Hiruma's bullet passes with one hand. He has a habit of posing every time he makes a spectacular catch for a touchdown, rolling after the jump, and breaking out of the roll by kneeling and pointing upwards with his index finger. He also has the habit of attaching 'Max' to nearly everything he does (suffixing his phrases with MAX! in the Japanese, and prefixing them with MAXI-! in the English), since he believes that one should give 100% effort in all endeavors.\n\r\nHe was named Monta after Sena mistook his name as Rai Montarou. He begins to like being called 'Monta' after Hiruma tells him the nickname 'Monta' was supposedly derived from Joe Montana. Monta does not know that Joe Montana is a quarterback, not a wide receiver. Monta has a crush on Mamori. He's always trying to win her heart, often failing miserably, because she always gives more attention to Sena. Monta's throwing is incredibly horrible: he moves his arm in the right direction, but somehow, the ball goes in a completely different direction! Not only that, but his kicking is similar. His throws/kicks usually hit someone on the head, or break a window. Monta is also known for his bad grammar, as he once said that he will \"restore his disgrace, but was corrected by Hiruma, and Hiruma even requested that someone \"teach that monkey how to communicate with humans,\" which embarrassed him even further.\n\r\nAt the same time, although he is considered an idiot, he gives wonderful motivational speeches, especially to Sena. Every time Sena felt like all was lost, Monta would give him a pep talk, leading Sena to start moving again.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "Jersey: 18 \n40 yard dash: 4.86 seconds \nBench Press: 70 kg \nHeight: 189 cm \nBirthday: March 12 \nQuote: \"If you can't aim for the top alone, then find someone to go with you.\" \n\nA typical, good-looking pop idol (he has a CD single due to recording technology, despite the fact that he can't sing), he works in an advertising company called Jari Productions. When he was young, he used to watch sports all the time and dreamed of becoming a professional athlete. In high school, he managed to enter the team as a Wide Receiver after drawing much attention from the seniors due to his height; however, the coach, Shoji, was more interested in Shin. Shin soon surpassed Sakuraba, becoming the ace of the team. Sakuraba felt a little envious of Shin's success and achievements, and was disappointed with himself for not being able to soar to greater heights. He eventually became less interested in training and sports in general. \n\nOne day, Miracle Ito of Jari Productions noticed him and decided that he would be a good model. Feeling wanted and pleased to be in the spotlight for once, Sakuraba agreed to work for him. Now, he is constantly misunderstood; because of his popularity, people mistake him for the genius of the Oujou team, and disregard the true ace, Shin. In fact, his football skills are mediocre at best, especially his catching ability. Sakuraba always felt pressured to do well and to live up to assumptions people made about him. An accident in the Oujou vs. Deimon game changed it all, though: Sena, as Eyeshield 21, accidentally tackled Sakuraba while running, injuring him. The reason that Sakuraba was hit, even though he was not playing at that time, was that he ran onto the field to grab a card that Miracle Ito told him to wear as advertisement. In the hospital, after meeting Sena, Monta and his die-hard fan Torakichi, who admires Sakuraba for his catch in the game against Deimon the year before, he finally decides to stop being pessimistic and to succeed just as Shin has done. Just before the Fall tournament started, he decided to quit working with Jari Productions and focus on American football with the help of his friends after he heard Takami complimenting him and how he had waited for a friend like Sakuraba, someone like him who understood his predicaments. Before the opening ceremony, he cut his hair in a crew-cut style and started growing a goatee to show his renewed vigor in pursuing success in American football, much to the dismay of Miracle Ito, who had depended on Sakuraba's good looks to make money. This has turned out probably for the best, as if Ito had seen Sakuraba at the end of 207th Down, he would have had a coronary on the spot. Due to Ootawara's usual thickheaded nature, he and Sakuraba lost the quiz game that Oujouu ran as part of its Autumn Festival by a mile\u2014which meant they had to do a forfeit: dress up in maid costumes. Ootawara looked ridiculous\u2014no change there\u2014but Sakuraba was a sight to behold. \n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He was first introduced in the series when Sena met him in the San Antonio stadium (Taki was trying out for the team there). He has a habit of opening his jacket to bare his pecs, making weird poses like rising up his leg 180 degrees and is often portrayed as a ladies-man. His dream is to become a pro football star, even though he didn't know the rules, nor the positions, stating that he was an all-around super player. He couldn't play American Football in Japan; he wasn't qualified, so he went to America to apply for a position in the San Antonio Team by taking all the savings in his house to fly to America. He failed; however, the coach did praise him on his potential and asked him to try out again after gaining some experience in high school football. Sena passed the pro-tryouts as Eyeshield 21, (though he and the Taki siblings left before his name was announced). Sena, feeling sorry for him, sensed that Taki had potential and that his talent shouldn't be wasted, asked him to join the Devil Bats back in Japan as a Tight End. He manages to qualify as a Devil Bats team member after undergoing the rest of the Death March.\n\r\nAlthough he's quite the clueless, narcissistic fool, he is undeniably a very good (not to mention useful) player in the team. His personality is noted to be gentlemanly, but he's still an idiotic, competitive showoff. Taki gets serious for the first time in the game against Bando and manages to out-perform Akaba. He also began wearing his hair in a samurai topknot. However, after getting a tiny bit of praise, he reverts back to his usual idiot persona.\n\r\nMonta harbors an intense dislike towards Taki; in junior high, while Monta was taking an entrance exam, Taki approached Monta and asked him whether a book he found earlier, Son Son (with a picture of a chimpanzee on it) was Monta's, since he thought that Monta looked like a chimp. Taki's flexibility is also comparable to Monta's, further deepening their rivalry.\n\r\nHe always addresses Suzuna as \"My Sister.\" His catchphrase is usually a loud \"AH-HA-HA!\" and exclaiming that he has a 150% success rate at anything he does. This usually leads to the Ha-Ha brothers being irritated at him.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She is a two-year-old robot created by Satomi Hakase to serve Evangeline and protect her during time where the spell binding her weakens her. She is initially without any real emotions, but after spending time around Negi, she begins to have feelings for him, and show emotions, such as embarrassment when the crush is brought up, her internal gears increasing in speed during moments where a human's heart would beat faster, and even leaking laser fluid from her eyes when she's upset. These feelings go against her original programming, which excites Hakase. She spends most of her free time helping people and rescuing stray animals. She strongly fears the idea that she is nothing more than a soulless doll and that she does not have a soul; however, during the Governor's ball in the Magic world she forms a pactio with Negi (in Nagi form) which appears to have a cat theme, proving that she does indeed have a soul; as Pactio contracts can only be formed between those with true souls.\n\r\nChachamaru's body is powered by an internal spring combined with magic, and it has to be wound with a key by someone with magical energy to power her. The actual winding process is apparently pleasurable and/or arousing, although too much magic can intensify the feeling to uncomfortable levels. She is skilled in hand to hand combat, and she is equipped with rocket fists, laser emitters, magic-powered thrusters that can allow her to fly for fifteen minutes, and a tool to undo binding circles. Her body has been upgraded several times, and she is later given a completely new body that looks completely human, unlike her original body's easily detectable parts; she even has a chibi body designed to disguise herself. The upgrade also allows her to transform her arms into swords and guns.",

After reading some info about Negi's father that was being passed around on the net, Haruna immediately grills Nodoka, Yue, and Konoka on the subject, and they quickly cave under pressure, telling her the truth about Negi, Magic, and probationary contracts. But unlike most of her classmates who react to the truth with a mixture of shock and denial, Haruna completely embraces magical society and lore from the start. She resolves to get a magical artifact, kissing Negi without warning the second she sees him before understanding how probationary contracts work, just so she can get an item.\nHaruna becomes the 6th person to perform a probationary contract with Negi. Her artifact, Imperium Graphices, when activated, becomes an artist's cap and apron with a notebook. The notebook can bring anything Haruna draws in it to life, from simple golems, to massive defensive or offensive constructs. The strength and function of said constructs is limited only by Haruna's imagination and the speed at which she can draw.\r\nHer breast size in class appears to be ranked 5th.",

She and Asuna seem to hate each other, with the two often getting into fights, but it eventually becomes clear that they merely have an odd, but surprisingly close friendship that neither is willing to admit to. She is the girl most overtly fond of Negi, though she stands by the position that she is only interested in Negi because he \"needs a mother figure.\" Though she is highly intelligent, she can often be clueless in relation to the events surrounding her. Thus, many of her classmates incorrectly think of her as a fool (even if they won't say so out loud).\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She is also the school dining officer. \n\r\nA very nice and hard-working person, Satsuki is liked by everyone in Mahora, even Evangeline (who sees the rest of the class as a pack of air-headed beasts) and Nitta (who views the middle school students, especially the ones from 3-A, as rowdy kids who need to be disciplined at all times). \n\r\nHer very presence creates an atmosphere of serenity, and she can quickly put a stop to fights even between the hot-headed students in the High School and University martial arts clubs. \n\r\nSatsuki's dream is to have her own restaurant, as she likes making people happy through her food.\n\r\nSatsuki has a unique way of speaking that is shown in the manga by depicting her words without a speech bubble.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, Negima Wikia)",

    "description": "Birthdate: March 17, 1989\n\r\nThe silent acrobat, and one of the most mysterious girls of the class. Nothing much is known about her, as she rarely associates with anybody, and even when she does, she rarely talks (she has spoken only eight times in the serialized manga thus far). What is known is that she is a member of the Nightmare Circus, the school's Acrobatic Club, and is seen directing a group of \"monsters\" or \"spirits\" (similar to No-Face from Spirited Away, the Angels from Neon Genesis Evangelion or possibly Hollows from Bleach) when she offered to cover for her classmates during the school festival, and gave Chao a tiny living dragon as a farewell gift. She also has been shown to see Sayo without the assistance of Negi or having a close relationship with her like Kazumi. According to Negi's Class Register, Zazie is also a member of the school's Magic Club, though whether this is real magic or stage conjuring is unknown. In the anime, she is shown to have proficiency in all kinds of circus tricks such as juggling, sleight of hand, and costume changing. She has dark skin, and has two particular face marks: a large teardrop under her left eye (strongly resembling the carnival character \"pierro\"), and a vertical line resembling a scar crossing the right side of her face. A splash picture of the cast shows her with claws growing from her fingers. She is sometimes seen with her pet bird, but more recently with her \"friends\" (the black spirit-monsters). So far, she is the least known of all the students in Negi's class and very little has been revealed about her.\n\r\nZazie is one of the few students in Class 3-A who did not participate in Negi's sojourn to Wales and the Magical World.\n\r\nWhen Zazie's name is seen it is written in the Latin alphabet, rather than in Japanese. Similarly, Evangeline's name is also written with the Roman alphabet. This seems to indicate that, like Evangeline, Zazie isn't from Japan and is instead from a country which uses the Roman alphabet. This is backed up by the fact that Chisame referred to her as a transfer student in volume 2.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Hakase is Chachamaru's creator and therefore the closest thing Chachamaru has to a mother. Hakase appears to have known about magic even before Negi came to Mahora, based on the fact that Chachamaru was made to run partially off magic, and all the conversations she has with Evangeline. She is the only person who knows for sure that Chachamaru is in love with Negi, and designs a more realistic skin-like covering for Chachamaru to help her out with her goal (Negi). During the school festival and before the martial arts tournament, she helps run the Chao Bao Zi diner cart with Satsuki. She is one of the few girls in the class who does not go with Negi on his trip to England.\n\nHakase is the right-hand \"girl\" of Chao Lingshen, and she helps Chao with her plan to reveal magic to the world by constructing an army of robots powered by the world tree's magic, as well as creating many anti- wizard measures to incapacitate the magic users of Mahora. \n\r\nHer motivations for helping Chao with her plan are never revealed. During Negi's final fight with Chao, Hakase becomes genuinely impressed with Negi's magical skill, which allows him to fight on par with her and Chao's most advanced technology.",
