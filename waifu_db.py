The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, \"Waltz For Venus\". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an \"accident\"). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly \"died\". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike's gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves \"too slow\". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye \"only sees the present\" and his left eye \"only sees the past.\" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or \"No Smoking\" signs."

            "description": "Faye Valentine\r\nBirthday: August 14, 1994\n\r\nOne of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.\n\r\nSeemingly little more than a thorn in her partners\u2019 sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in \"Cowboy Funk\") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler & Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.\n\n She is a woman who is skilled at getting what she wants; however, her indomitable exterior hides a more delicate interior. Upon awakening from her 54-year cryogenic sleep, not only was she saddled with a massive amount of debt that she had no means to pay, but she was also diagnosed with total amnesia, a stranger in a mysterious world that she was not a part of and did not understand, surrounded by people who claimed to be helping her but were only there to take advantage of her naivet\u00e9. The surname \"Valentine\" was merely a name given to her by the doctor who woke her; the circumstances of her accident, her previous life, and even her real name all remain a mystery, and are only gradually revealed as the series progresses. It has been hinted that she came from Singapore on Earth, and was the daughter of a very wealthy family, as the city's famous Merlion Statue features prominently in scenes of her childhood, and that memories and a film from her childhood showed her living in a large mansion. In an early episode, she states that she is descended from Roma people, but she may well have been lying. Utterly betrayed by someone she thought she could trust after waking, Faye found herself burdened with even more money to pay, and the situation resulted in the hardening of her personality to an extreme degree. She even says in Session 11: \u201cwe deceive or we are deceived\u201d, and that \u201cnothing good ever happened to me when I trusted others.\u201d \r\nThroughout the series, though she retains her sarcastic demeanor and unpleasant nature up until the very end, it is easy to see her grow as a character. She learns to value her comrades, coming back to the Bebop when she realizes that it is the only home that she has left, naming it as the \u201conly place I could return to\u201d. She grows to understand the disadvantages of being a loner, and that even though her \"family\" is somewhat dysfunctional it is still a place where she will always belong."

            "description": "Jet, known on his home satellite as the \"Black Dog\" for his tenacity, is a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede (a Jovian satellite) and acts as Spike's foil during the series. Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or \"dad\" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old).\n\r\nJet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet \"customized\" with larger engines).\n\r\nDuring the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.\n\nIn a later episode, another Vicious/Spike parallel is set up when Jet finds out that it was his old partner Fad who betrayed him (though in Jet's case, there was no love affair involved). Fad arranged for Jet's death in a setup, but he survived with only a missing arm and a scar on his face. It is worth noting that Jet managed to face the demons of his past and let them go, in contrast to Spike, who was killed when he confronted his. This is likely due to the contrast in the two approaches to the past. While Spike hid and fled from his past, Jet tracked it down and confronted it."

Ein is a \"data dog\": while the televised series only briefly hints on the fact that this means Ein's brain was somehow enhanced drastically, the manga shows Ed accessing data stored in Ein's brain via a virtual reality-type interface with which she has a conversation with a human proprietor. It is obvious that Ein is abnormally intelligent, as he is able to answer the telephone, drive a car (just the wheel), use the SSW, play sh\u014dgi, and generally do a number of other things that an average canine should not be able to do, but he never talks in a human language during the show. He does, however, speak in Session 18 \"Speak Like A Child\" after the credits Ein tells Spike \"Next Episode: Wild Horses\". He is able to \"speak\" to other species, as demonstrated in Session 17, \"Mushroom Samba\" (he spoke to a cow with a subtitled bark of \"Thanks\", to which the cow has a subtitled moo back of \"No problem\"). It is likely that Ed is the only crew member with any idea of Ein's capabilities, as the other crew members are quick to dismiss Ein, and never seem to acknowledge him as more than a pet. Ein initially takes a shine to Jet, but when Ed joins the crew, he comes around to her as well. Frequently the two trade roles, with Ein expressing very human sentiments via facial expression and Ed regressing to a feral state. He went with Ed after she left the crew, probably because of his attachment to her. His name is a pun on the Japanese word for \"dog\" (\u72ac inu) but is also German for \"one\". \"Ein\" may also be short for \"Einstein\", after Albert Einstein, because of the extraordinary intelligence he possesses."

            "description": "Race: Human, Shinigami, Visored, Fullbringer, Quincy\r\nBirthday: July 15 (Cancer)\r\nAge: 15 (beginning); 17 (currently)\r\nHeight: 174->181 cm\r\nWeight: 61->66 kg\r\nKnown Relatives: Isshin Kurosaki (father), Masaki Kurosaki (mother, deceased), Yuzu Kurosaki (younger sister), Karin Kurosaki (younger sister),  Orihime Inoue (wife), Kazui Kurosaki (son)\r\nTheme Songs: \"Number One\" by Hazel Fernandes, \"News From the Front\" by Bad Religion\n\r\nFor the most part, Ichigo appears like a normal teenage boy, the one exception to that is his spiky, orange hair, a trait which he has been ridiculed about for years. He is a fairly tall, and lean-built person with peach skin and brown eyes. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears standard Shinigami attire with the addition of a strap across his chest.\n\r\nWhen he was young, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world. Ichigo always smiled whenever he was with Masaki and he was regularly at her side, holding her hand.\n\r\nAs a teenager, Ichigo's personality is much more complex. Stubborn, short-tempered, occasionally confrontational, determined, outspoken, strong-willed and impulsive, he attempts to maintain a detached and \"cool\" image, despite claiming to not care about what other people think about him. He generally keeps his face set in a permanent scowl with his eyebrows drawn together. Ichigo carries the burden of the real world and the spirit world (Soul Society), a task quite difficult, especially for a teenager like Ichigo, who has his own worries and problems. Also, Ichigo is quite smart; he was ranked 23rd in his high school. He does this partly to prove to his teachers and classmates that just because he's unique, or somewhat punkish, that he can still succeed.\n\r\nWhen Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakut\u014d is a standard-looking katana, but oversized with an equally-oversized brown sheathe hung by a strap over his right shoulder. It has a rectangular bronze hand guard with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short ones. The handle is red with two light blue tassels on the end of the handle. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo's spiritual power, which he didn't know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It was even able to upturn the ground with a single strike. Because of its weak spiritual energy nature, Byakuya Kuchiki was able to easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo and Kisuke Urahara subsequently slices it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakut\u014d in order to release its true form. This sword is found to be a result of Rukia's deprived spiritual energy and not a result of his own power.\n\nIchigo is an extremely rare case. Despite being a Shinigami, he is still a living Human being and resides in the Human World, rather than in Soul Society. Uniquely, he gained his own powers through Urahara's training/forced encroachment, which simultaneously gave him Hollow powers. Due to his Hollow powers, Ichigo is technically classified as a Visored, but he still thinks and refers to himself as a Shinigami. For all purposes, Ichigo is a Human in physical body and Visored in spiritual body, thus making his situation even rarer. After losing his Shinigami powers Ichigo returns to being a human, this time with no spiritual power or spiritual awareness at all. His enormous spiritual power capacity was being Kurosaki Isshin's Offspring, letting him see ghosts and hollows from a very young age. It was revealed that he has access to Quincy powers, due to his mother."

            "description": "Occupation: Shinigami in the 13th Division Lieutenant of Squad 13\r\nCaptain of Squad 13(end)\nBirthday: January 14 (Capricorn)\nHeight: 144 cm (4' 8\")\nWeight: 33 kg (72.6 lb)\nHair: Black\nEyes: Violet/Dark Purple\nZanpakutou: Sode no Shirayuki\nShikai Command: Mae (Dance), Sode no Shirayuki\nTheme Song: \"Wing-Stock\" by Ashley MacIsaac\n\r\nRukia and her older sister, Hisana, were brought together to 78th District of Rukongai after they died in the human world. Hisana abandoned Rukia when she was still a baby since she could not continue to support both herself and Rukia. Rukia grew up on her own until she met Renji Abarai and other children her age. They worked together to steal food in order to survive and became a makeshift family. She's a bit of a tomboy to show that she's tough. During this time, Rukia and Renji showed signs of having spiritual power. While they initially opted against becoming shinigami, the death of all their friends prompted Rukia to suggest joining the academy for a better life.\n\r\nAt the shinigami academy, Renji was admitted into the top class and Rukia into the second ranked one. Renji and Rukia started growing further apart as Renji got further ahead in his training. The emotional distance continued until Rukia was asked to join the Kuchiki family. Renji expressed happiness for Rukia's opportunity but both did not admit that they disagreed with the arrangement since they would likely never see each other again. Rukia reluctantly joined the family and was immediately inducted into the 13th Division without having to graduate or take a squad entrance exam. Unknown to Rukia, Byakuya had adopted her in order to fulfill the last wish of Hisana, whom he had taken as his wife.\n\r\nIn the 13th Division, Rukia was not given a seat position, due to Byakuya Kuchiki's influence, since he did not want her sent on dangerous missions. She became friends with the division lieutenant, Kaien Shiba, who trained and mentored her. Their first training location was Mount Koifushi of Hokutan, the 3rd district of West Rukongai.\n\r\nRukia greatly admired Kaien's wife, 3rd Seat Miyako Shiba. When Miyako was killed by a hollow, Rukia, Kaien, and the division's captain, J\u016bshir\u014d Ukitake hunted the hollow down. Kaien faced the hollow alone but the hollow's special ability destroyed his zanpakut\u014d. Rukia attempted to draw her sword and help but was stopped by Ukitake. He told her that Kaien's fight was one of honor rather than a fight for his life. If Rukia helped, Kaien would be saved but his honor would be damaged forever. Meanwhile, the hollow entered Kaien and possessed him. Ukitake faced the hollow but his illness allowed the hollow the opportunity to attack Rukia. Kaien momentarily regained control and thrust himself through Rukia's zanpakut\u014d. He thanked Rukia and Ukitake for letting him fight for his honor and died in Rukia's arms. Rukia brought the corpse to the Shiba family but was afraid to apologize since she felt guilty about her role in Kaien's death.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

She does not remove her hairpins, except to sleep (she is seen without them in episode 64 when she wakes up), as they are worn in memory of her brother, while her hair is worn long in honor of the promise Tatsuki Arisawa once made to protect her. Her large breasts are occasionally made the subject of jokes in the series. She also has an amazingly hard head, which has injured Ury\u016b, Chad, and Ichigo. The only person who has been able to damage her head has been Yachiru Kusajishi in a comical moment when she is riding on Kenpachi Zaraki's shoulders. Orihime has yellow-orange/brown eyes in colored pictures of the manga, but gray eyes in the anime.\n\r\nOrihime is friendly, humorous in her own way, sensitive, and kind. She comes off as naive and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school. Apparently, she is hopeless when it comes to technology. One of the members of the Handicrafts' Club remarks that she is not smart enough to use a cell phone, which is why she does not have one. Additionally, according to Tatsuki, Orihime has the fighting skill of a black belt, however, in the English dubbed version she says Orihime is at the skill of a yellow belt.\n\r\nOrihime cooks and eats strange food at home, although she also likes some normal food. Aside from Rangiku Matsumoto and possibly Tessai Tsukabishi, no one shares Orihime's tastes. Her favorite food is red bean paste, and she likes putting butter on sweet potatoes.\n\r\nOrihime has a tendency to rush into situations without thinking, sometimes leading to embarrassing consequences. At one point, the schoolgirls ask Rukia if she has feelings for Ichigo. When Rukia denies any such thing, Orihime is disappointed that Rukia does not share her sentiments, because if she had, then it would be two girls against one boy and therefore the girls \"team\" would win, which makes no sense. She also tends to have an overactive imagination and gets carried away thinking of implausible scenarios, such as portraying herself as a futuristic and apparently highly destructive robot in an assignment asking \"How do you see yourself in the future?\", when the question refers to what occupation one wishes or believes they will have.\n\r\nOrihime has also demonstrated that she is perceptive, mostly when it comes to Ichigo Kurosaki. She is in love with Ichigo, and in both the manga and anime, her feelings only become more evident as time goes on. She has revealed these feelings both to Rangiku Matsumoto and to Ichigo himself, though he was asleep at the time. She also has the uncanny ability to detect Ichigo by scent and sense his spiritual pressure, even when masked by the visored.\n\r\nOrihime lives by herself in Karakura Town, where the story takes place, and is supported by relatives living elsewhere. Previously, she had lived with her older brother, Sora, who was fifteen years older than her. She and her brother were raised by a drunk father and an unfaithful mother, who always argued and beat their children. It is unknown if her parents are still alive.\n\r\nWhen Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her since. For six years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her long hair. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. On the same day, Sora was wounded in a car accident and died in the Kurosaki clinic. Orihime has worn the hairpins ever since. A year after Sora died, Orihime met Tatsuki who defended her from the bullies. They have been best friends ever since."

            "description": "Age: 15-16 (series), 18 (movie, end of the series)\r\nBirthday: 1899\r\nBirthplace: Resembool, Amestris\r\nFamily: Alphonse Elric (brother); Trisha Elric (mother, deceased); Van Hohenheim (father)\r\nAffiliations: State Military, Winry Rockbell, Pinako Rockbell, Izumi Curtis (teacher), Roy Mustang (Commander)\r\nSpecies: Human\r\nOccupation: State Alchemist\r\nAbilities: Alchemy, Martial Arts\r\nWeapon: Alchemy, automail arm and leg\n\r\nEdward \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" Elric is a young alchemical prodigy. He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.\n\r\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11\"), however, his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\n\r\nBorn to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dead mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\n\r\nEdward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. \n\r\nThough instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the \"One is All, All is One\" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics of a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.\n\r\nDevising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.\n\r\nAlphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God's domain and peeking at the Gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life.\n\r\nOn the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbell's in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother's body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automail at age 11 when it took most adults 3 years."

With his parents and family now gone, his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.\n\r\nAfter his fight with Naruto, he believes he's been wasting his time \"playing ninja\" with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing Itachi and then restore the Uchiha clan.\n\r\nAs a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.\n\r\nClaiming at first that he doesn't need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. Sasuke openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.\n\nAppearance\r\nSasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.\n\r\nAt the beginning of Part I, Sasuke's clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.\n\r\nIn Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that's open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. He also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in Curse Seal Level 2 room to move (also without transforming).\n\nSasuke, even though claiming to be emotionless, wouldn't kill unless it was necessary until Madara Uchiha twisted his personality even further by telling him that his brother, Itachi, after he had killed him, was ordered to kill their clan and suffer for the sake of the village. After knowing this, he suddenly turns far colder and seeks for revenge on Konoha. However, after he had calmed down, he noticed how confused he really was and revived Orochimaru to request answers to his questions about his clan, Konoha, and what shinobi and the Hokage really are. He's currently helping Naruto and the others put an end to the war and announced that he plans to become the next Hokage. But when the the war concluded, Sasuke made it clear that his goal was to become a new kind of Hokage, a kind of Hokage that wants to banish darkness from the Ninja World and to do so he believes all the old Kages should be killed. He also wants to conclude things with Naruto and so he invites him to one final concluding battle. The battle ends with both Naruto and Sasuke losing one of their hands. While both lie on the ground he finally accepts Naruto's feelings and stops his path of revenge to return to the village.\nIn chapter 700, it is shown that he has a daughter with Sakura."

Run, run and cling to life.\n\r\nBackground:\r\nItachi Uchiha is a missing-nin from Konohagakure, and a prominent member of Akatsuki, partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki. He is Sasuke Uchiha's older brother. \n\r\nItachi is relatively popular among many fans of Naruto, often having ranked in the top ten in Shonen Jump magazine's popularity polls since his introduction. He was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. He was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.\n\r\nItachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi's prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre.\n\r\nHe was praised highly by his father, who saw the family's future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi's younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.\n\nWhen the Uchiha began planning to overthrow Konoha, Itachi, as an ANBU, was tasked with spying on the village. Knowing that a coup d'etat would only lead to another Ninja War, Itachi chose to spy on the Uchiha instead, passing on information to the Third Hokage and the other Konoha elders. After this he began to act strangely, not attending the clan meetings, speaking out against the clan, and becoming the prime suspect for the murder of his best friend, Shisui Uchiha. The clan lost hope in Itachi, and his father began shifting his focus to Sasuke instead. Meanwhile, the Third's attempts to negotiate a bloodless end to hostilities between the two parties were proving ineffective, so, against the Third's wishes, Danzo and the Konoha Council ordered Itachi to wipe out the Uchiha.\n\r\nBefore the fateful night arrived, Itachi discovered the existence of Madara Uchiha, who was attempting to rekindle the flames of war in Konoha. In return for not attacking Konoha, Itachi offered to help Madara claim vengeance against the Uchiha for turning their backs on him decades earlier. Madara agreed. Itachi slaughtered his entire clan overnight, sparing only Sasuke. Sasuke's life was worth more than the village to Itachi, and he could not follow through with the orders to kill him as well. Instead, he made himself out as a villain, who had killed their innocent family only to test his abilities. By doing so, he wanted Sasuke to take vengeance on him and become a hero to Konoha, thus redeeming the Uchiha name. He tortured Sasuke with his Mangekyo Sharingan, and encouraged him to become strong enough to kill him and avenge their family. Hoping that his beloved little brother would someday be powerful enough to kill him, Itachi left the village as a traitor.\n\r\nKnowing that Konoha would still want to eliminate Sasuke, Itachi pleaded with the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe. He also threatened Danzo to not harm Sasuke or risk him revealing everything he knew about Konoha's secrets to enemy countries. Sasuke's safety was therefore secured, and Itachi returned to his original plan of becoming infamous for his slaughter of the Uchiha. \n\r\nItachi joined Akatsuki in order to keep an eye on the organization, along with Madara Uchiha, in case either ever acted against Konoha, all the while planning for his death at Sasuke's hands. While a member of Akatsuki, Itachi was approached by Orochimaru, who tried to steal his body to gain the Sharingan. Itachi trapped him in a genjutsu and severed his left hand as punishment, forcing Orochimaru to flee the organization. Sometime after joining Akatsuki, Itachi later helped recruit Deidara, Orochimaru's replacement, by beating him in battle, after which Deidara swore vengeance again.\r\nPersonality:\nEver since his first appearance, Itachi had always been mysterious, and had acted as though he was hiding his true self. While flashbacks to his past showed that he was a compassionate brother and person, his later acts and claims made it seem that this was mostly just an act. But, surprisingly, he genuinely was the compassionate brother he had once claimed to be, although he hid this from the rest of the Akatsuki to protect Sasuke.\r\nAs a member of Akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. He constantly displayed an emotionless personality. He only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn't lose his composure. He did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.\n\r\nIn addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, Itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. He was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. He also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, Itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.\n\r\nItachi's only initial interest was in Akatsuki's goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization's success and secrecy before everything else. As such, Itachi got along with his partner, Kisame, much better than most other Akatsuki members did with their own partners. Kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to Itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. Itachi treated all of his fellow Akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.\n\nHowever, when he was in a genjutsu duel during his fight with Sasuke, he cruelly claimed he'd only let Sasuke live so that he could take Sasuke's eyes and obtain his own Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, after which he then claimed the Uchiha clan had been nothing but tainted and evil, since many members would kill their friends to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan, and would take another Uchiha's eyes to make its power permanent. Once the genjutsu was released, he called it his true self, implying his calm, emotionless personality was also a facade. This persona was later revealed to be only an act to ensure that he would die by Sasuke's hands, his love for his younger brother being the fundamental aspect of his personality. \r\nDespite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. While living in Konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. After joining Akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. He was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.\n\r\nHe, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. He also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his Akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). Being brothers, Itachi and Sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. Itachi's hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. His skin was also slightly darker. Itachi's most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.\n\r\nWhen he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large Uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. When on duty, he would wear the traditional ANBU uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the traditional Akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. After his cloak was incinerated by Sasuke's Kirin during their fight in Part II, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. Like almost all members of Akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, Konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village (although, secretly, he was actually still loyal to his village).\r\nAbilities:\r\nSince a young age, Itachi's intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. In the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, Itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the Naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat Deidara, Sasuke, Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yuhi and Orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in Naruto. Being a pacifist, Itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.\n\r\nSharingan:\r\nBeing of the Uchiha Clan, and as noted by Kakashi, Itachi was a true successor of the Sharingan Eye. From a stationary position, he would study an opponent's movements with his Sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. He could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent's genjutsu against them with Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change. Itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his Sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels. \n\r\nMangekyo Sharingan:\r\nItachi possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. With his left eye, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent's mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. His final technique was Susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"Raging God of Battle\" in the databook. It wielded the Totsuka Sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and Yata's Mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. Zetsu, a fellow Akatsuki member, stated that Itachi's mastery of the Sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of Susanoo, made him invincible.\n\nDespite his mastery of the Mangekyo Sharingan, Itachi suffered greatly from its side effects. His eyesight would worsen after every activation of the Mangekyo Sharingan, and he would eventually go blind from its power, with his Sharingan forever sealed away. Itachi was so close to blindness that, by the time he activated Susanoo in his final fight, both Sharingan eyes had become almost blind, and had turned white. However, he was still able to perform his own F\u016binjutsu in his last moments.\r\n(Source: Naruto.com, Naruto Wikia)"

He lives with his mother, Hiroko Makunouchi, and helps with the family charter boat fishing business. Ippo is a classic power in-boxer and is well known for his Peek-a-Boo style of boxing and hard punches which include three signature punches: a rib-cracking liver blow, Gazelle punch (an uppercut variant), and the Dempsey roll technique. His signature punches appear to be modelled after Mike Tyson, Floyd Patterson and Jack Dempsey respectively.\n\r\nIppo is bullied throughout most of his school life. After being rescued by Takamura, he ends up being brought to Kamogawa Gym, where he displays an explosive punching power. After seeing a video of Mike Tyson, he becomes inspired to take up boxing to feel reborn with strength. He soon proves himself to Takamura and Kamogawa, and starts on the path to being a pro boxer.\n\r\nHis Pro-Debut Match was against Oda Yusuke, He was largely regarded as a lazy and unmotivated boxer, but when his girlfriend threatened to break up with him, he committed himself to training. From the first time the boxers met, there was tension between them, as a misunderstanding led Oda to believe Ippo made fun of him. On the actual fight, Ippo seemed to have the advantage from the beginning of the match, but was saved by his coach from losing the fight due to a cut. Ippo managed a comeback by knocking Oda out with a series of jabs, thus winning the fight.\n\nAfter winning two fights upon his debut as a pro-boxer, Coach Kamogawa enlisted Ippo in the East Japan Rookie King Tournament. Ippo also had his personal goal in the tournament to fight with Miyata in the Pro Ring for their tie-breaker match. With this promise in mind Ippo aims to reach the East Japan finals.\n\r\nFirst Round: Jason Ozuma Ozuma is a black officer from America who was stationed in Japan, and the only black boxer Ippo has faced so far. Jason is a very polite and kind man who cares greatly for his gym and friends. His most revered attacks, his devastating Hooks, are comparable to Takamura's in terms of speed. Ippo had to enter an in fight to win the first round. Ippo took major hits, but managed to turn the match around by pressuring Ozuma with his power. After an intense round, Ippo managed to take advantage of Ozuma's wide swing and his delayed punch, due to a broken rib, to deliver a second down and win the match.\n\r\nSecond Round: Kobashi Kenta Kobashi Kenta is a boxer that depends on winning with points. Ippo is annoyed by Kobashi's technique, which is to clinch often; eventually Kobashi's strategy, to rob Ippo of his stamina, takes effect. However, in the final round (the 4th round), Kobashi punches Ippo with a counter and becomes excited at the prospect of landing a KO on Ippo. Even though his second disapproved, his desire to gain a KO victory lead him to fight head-on, but Ippo took his chance the instant Kobashi stepped outside the pure, no-risk outboxing and KO'ed him.\n\r\nSemi-final Round: Hayami Ryuuichi A pretty boy boxer who held the title of Inter High Champion with his fast barrage of punches called the Shotgun and Ippo's first opponent as an out boxer. Hayami looked down upon Ippo, and dismissed him since he felt Ippo was an unworthy opponent. Hayami's strategy uses a short uppercut against dashing infighters and finishes them with his Shotgun. Ippo, however, manages to counter him by using a cross hook counter against his short uppercut, and sees through the storm of punches. Having finally mastered bobbing and weaving at the training camp, he was able to avoid and get close to Hayami. Ippo finished the fight with a rush followed by an uppercut to win the fight in 1 round moving to the finals.\n\r\nEast Japan Final Round: Mashiba Ryou Ippo's final opponent in the East Japan Rookie King tournament defeated Miyata with a controversial foul and seemed poised to take the Rookie King Title. Ippo met Mashiba at his pro license exam, and has since been afraid of his dark demeanor throughout most of the series (albeit comically), but after witnessing Mashiba's foul, Ippo goes into the match determined to win. Initially, Mashiba's flicker jabs exploited Ippo's short reach by keeping him at bay, but Ippo eventually slipped in, broke Mashiba's elbow (at the expense of his right hand), and slugged it out with him. Ippo gave Mashiba his first and only legitimate black star in the form of a heavy and painful K.O victory.\n\nSince Ippo had broken his fist, the All Japan Round didn't seem like a possibility, but when Ippo met Sendou, the West Japan Rookie King, in person, he decided to go ahead with the fight. He received therapy from Doctor Yamaguchi which allowed him to fight with a proper hand. The match was an intense slug-fight which ended abruptly before the fourth round when Sendou turned out to be unconscious in his corner, despite still sitting upright looking ready to continue.\nAfter winning the All Japan Rookie Tournament, Ippo found that his rival Miyata was going overseas. Ippo was left with no current goal to motivate him. Rehabilitating his hand injured from his previous fight, Ippo breaks from training and starts supporting his fellow boxers at Kamogawa Gym in their fights. He then meets the current National Feather Weight Champion Date Eiji, who hints that in the future they may face each other since Ippo is already ranked number 10 upon winning the Rookie King Tournament. Ippo realizes that he wants to fight the Champion and trains for his new challenge. And he proceeds to do this by entering an A class tournemant and defeating Okita Keigo,  Saeki Takuma and  Alexander Volg Zangief.   Date Eiji After earning his right to challenge Date Eiji, one of Japan's most revered boxers, Ippo went into the match bringing everything he had learned in his past 10 matches with him. For the first few rounds he succeeded in pushing the champion to his limits. However, when Eiji began using the high-level Neck Spin to negate most of the power behind Ippo's punches, Ippo becomes disoriented. Eiji gradually returns to his style of fighting from his younger days. He delivers a powerful Heart Break Shot that stuns Ippo, then prepares to deliver the finishing blow. But the referee stops the match because Kamogawa had already thrown in the towel. Victory goes to  Date Eiji. Thanks to this match, Date regains his confidence in challenging the world champion, Ricardo Martinez. He relinquishes his belt, leaving Sendou Takeshi and Alexander Volg Zangief to fight for it. Sendou wins by a controversial decision and becomes the new Japanese Featherweight champion. Ponchai Chuwatana A Thai fighter ranked 3rd in Thailand who faces Ippo following his 5 month break against Date Eiji. Ponchai had a very well-built physique and a strong determination to win in his boxing matches.in the second round, Ippo starts to land small punches while swaying left and right, before speeding up and finishing Ponchai off with his new finishing move, the \"Dempsey Roll.\"After this match, Sendou, the new featherweight champion, challenged Ippo to a match personally. Sendou Takeshi The continuation of the unfinished match between the hard punchers of East and West. Ippo and Sendou had been looking forward to a match since the All Japan Rookie Championship was unfinished in their minds. To prepare for the match they both strengthened their weaknesses through new training methods, Sendou improving his lower body and Ippo his upper body.\n\r\nThis match is considered to be one of the most intense since both fighters had roughly the same amount of punching power resulting in numerous slug fests and a footstomp from the audience that shook the hall. Ippo originally had problems since he had a smaller body, meaning he had a little bit less muscle and was going to lose unless he started to connect more punches than Sendou did. But with encouragement from his friends and remembering his training he managed to continue his match against Sendou. The match turned into a mix up, where both fighters drew out the others' potential and helped each other grow stronger. With one final showdown between their signature finishers, Ippo managed to pull through and finish Sendou off by inventing a combo of his 3 strongest techniques to take the belt and title. Sendou then personally congratulated Ippo.\nAfter obtaining the National Japanese Feather Weight Belt from Sendou, Ippo defended the title successfully for eight consecutive times.\nAfter yet another canceled fight with Ichiro Miyata, Ippo lost his drive and thought of retiring from boxing. However with the help of Iimura Mari and the words of his friends and previous opponent, he was able to find his true goal which is to become strong and went back to Kamogawa Gym to continue Boxing. Kamogawa then tells Ippo to aim for the World, but having them cut off the shortest route of getting to the top rankings by beating the OPBF Champ Miyata, Kamogawa tells Ippo that he will take a different path, which is to defeat all of the OPBF National Champions, obtaining their WBC rankings and becoming an unofficial OPBF Champion.\nAfter his fight with Kojima, Ippo was told by the coach that he would be relinquishing the JBC Featherweight Title and moving up to challenging world rankers. His first match as a world contender is against Alfredo Gonzales, the 2nd ranked Featherweight in the WBA and 3rd ranked Featherweight in the WBC.  in the 7th round, the boxers enter yet another exchange which Ippo wins, but as he goes for the finishing blow, Alfredo lands a powerful right counter and sends Ippo to the canvas, where he lays motionless. Kamogawa runs into the ring to help Ippo and the referee declares a TKO.\n\r\nAs of this fight, Alfredo is the second person to knock Ippo unconscious.\nTotal Fights: 25. Wins: 23, All of which are by KO. Losses: 3."

            "description": "The self-invented personal name of an elite net-diver from Earth, hacker \"Radical Edward\" is a very strange, somewhat androgynous, teenage girl assumed to be around 13 years in age. She has a feral aspect reflected in her mannerisms, bare feet, strange postures and gangling walk.\n\r\nEd could be considered a \"free spirit\"; she is fond of silly exclamations and childish rhymes, easily distracted, and the show's primary source of physical humor.\n\r\nOver the course of the show she rarely walks anywhere, preferring to run, crawl, flip, roll, walk on her hands, or even just saunter. Ed is always barefoot. In one episode, she considers putting on socks and shoes, but quickly removes them, as even wearing socks hampers her, and she falls over seconds after putting them on; she also appears to be exceptionally strong and flexible, being able to support her weight on her arms for several minutes at a time, and to scratch her nose with her toe.\n\r\nIn the English version, she almost always refers to herself in the third person.\n\r\nNot much is known about her origins, only that she spent some of her earlier childhood in an orphanage after being left there by her father, a man named Afedersiniz Hesap L\u00fctfen (he calls Ed \"Fran\u00e7oise\", and may be of Turkish origin as his name means \"excuse me, check please\" in Turkish). In the manga it is revealed that she was a friend of a timid young boy in the orphanage known simply as \"Tomato\" (which also happens to be the brand name scrawled in katakana on her PC) who, like Ed, knew a great deal about computers and the net, and it is probably safe to assume that his friendship with Ed helped turn her into the genius-hacker she is today.\n\r\nEd's primary use to the Bebop crew is as a hacker; she is widely known to be a whiz kid behind a computer. Ed's computer of choice is a carry-along Tomato desktop, an homage to the portable flatpanel-outfitted Apple IIc from the 80s, and when traveling by foot she will balance it on her head.\n\r\nEd has a strong rapport with Jet, who acts as a surrogate father, and Faye, who acts as something of a big sister (much to Faye's chagrin). Ed also seems to be the only person who can understand Ein (though in a few instances Jet could understand Ein also)."

When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village, sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.\n\r\nDespite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto be viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a Jinchuuriki) the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demon were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracized by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.\n\r\nNaruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.\n\r\nVowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.\n\r\nIn all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.\n\nHe becomes the hero of his village, after defeating the six Pains all by himself.\nHe then befriends the nine-tails inside of him and control its powers. In time, he also becomes more dependable considering the Shinobi Alliance completely relies and respects his power, even the reanimated previous Hokages.\nHe later receives chakra from all the nine tailed beasts and then gains the power of the sage of the six paths, along with Sasuke.\nAt the end of the manga, he is married to Hinata with two children, Boruto and Himawari, and becomes the seventh hokage."

She cut her hair short because of a little boy who got gum stuck in it, but this action caused the Host club to mistake her for guy. However, unlike the other students, she is from a commoner family and got into Ouran through a scholarship. On her first day at school, she accidentally breaks a vase worth 8 million yen belonging to the Host Club. As a result, she is forced to work as a host to pay off her debt, and does so by disguising herself as a boy. Soon enough, she naturally takes to acting as a host to other girls, and even finds it enjoyable. However, she does not like to take time away from studying and often finds the antics of the other hosts to be annoying. Haruhi lives with her okama (cross dressing) father. As a result of her mother passing away when she was young, Haruhi has become very independent and never lets anyone worry about her. Although seemingly unflappable, she has a fear of thunderstorms.\n\nHaruhi was very popular back in middle school, and was confessed to at least once a month. However, like Tamaki, she is very dense when it comes to love, and has broken many hearts unintentionally. Later in the manga, she realizes her love for Tamaki, and begins to blush whenever he is around.\n\r\nEventually she leaves Japan to study abroad and, of course, the whole club joins her (even Honey and Mori!). In the last chapter of the manga there's a picture of Tamaki and her getting married."

Because of his family situation, Tamaki sees the Host Club as one big family and tries to maintain that illusion, to the extent of telling himself that his love for Haruhi is fatherly even when it is clearly not.\n\r\nLater in the manga, Tamaki gets closer to Haruhi even though he says it's mostly like a father; however, he tells Kyoya the reason why he hasn't been cheerful is because of his stricken love for Haruhi.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

He can send people flying with one kick, and has been told by the Japanese Defense Minister to never show his full power for fear of other countries thinking Japan had a weapon of mass destruction.

Because of him, Honey tried to act like a \"real man\" for some time, but after Tamaki convinced him that liking cute things was not bad, Honey dropped his fa\u00e7ade and joined the host club along with Mori, his cousin and the person he is often seen around with. Honey carries a stuffed bunny named \"Bun-bun\" (in Japanese, it is called \"Usa-chan,\" an abbreviation of usagi, meaning rabbit) that his beloved grandmother made for him. Like Kyouya, Honey is very ill-tempered when he wakes up, and gets very violent towards those that disturb his sleep.\n\nIn the extra page of volume 18 released last April 2011, it is said that Honey-senpai was the first one who got married among the members of the host club.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

He and his younger identical twin, Kaoru, are \"little devil\" type hosts who put on an act of \"forbidden brotherly love\" (with Hikaru as the seme) to draw in their clients. Unlike Tamaki, the Hitachiin brothers are wholly calculating in their customer relations; however, this is because of their deep dependency of each other, and a reluctance to let anyone into their world. They share a deep emotional bond, which was forged through a lonely childhood and the painful fact that no one could ever tell them apart without looking at the parting of their hair (Hikaru's hair parts to the right; Kaoru's parts to the left). Since Haruhi is the first person that can truthfully tell them apart, they greatly treasure her friendship. Haruhi has stated that Hikaru and Kaoru have their differences, despite being identical twins. Of the two, Hikaru is a little more in-control of their twincest acts, but is also more childish and immature than Kaoru, though he is the older twin.\n\nTamaki was the one who coerced the brothers into joining the Host Club in their last year of middle school. Since they told him they would join if he could guess which one was Hikaru, Tamaki repeatedly followed them around, tossing out random guesses as to who was Hikaru and who was Kaoru. They finally crumbled, and decided to join, which was their first step towards a greater exposure to a world outside of their own. Later in the manga, both Hikaru and Kaoru fall in love with Haruhi; although she has already rejected him once, Hikaru is determined to not lose to Tamaki. Eventually, however, Hikaru accepts that Haruhi loves Tamaki, and instead encourages her to confess to him, saying he is over her and wants her and Tamaki to get together (although he always looks pained as he says this).\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Despite Tamaki being president, Kyouya truly runs the club and plays the role of a puppet-master behind the scenes, earning him the nickname \"Shadow King.\" He takes care of the Host Club's expenses and will even sell items belonging to the host club members (such as Haruhi's pencil) for profit. In his words, \"use whatever is at hand, be it friend or foe.\" Almost everything he does is for his own benefit, but he can occasionally display a selfless side. He is the third son of his very wealthy and influential family; thus, if he wants to take over his family's business, he must work extremely hard to meet his strict father's high expectations. Also, Kyouya's bad temper when waking up in the morning has earned him the name \"Low-Blood Pressure Evil Lord.\"\n\nDespite being Tamaki's opposite, Kyouya has been known to support him in certain situations. One example being episode 8. Haruhi tried saving a bunch of girls from a group of molesters by throwing shells at them. One of them threw her over the edge of a small cliff. Tamaki rescued her, but later yelled at her for intervening and that girls shouldn't try to fight a group of boys. Haruhi countered that by saying that being a girl or boys doesn't matter in the real world. Later, she wandered into Kyouya's room in the villa they were staying at and Kyouya threw Haruhi on his bed and attempted to rape her. She told him that he wouldn't do it because he wouldn't gain anything. He backed off and Haruhi realized he did what he did to prove that she couldn't defend herself. His rape attempt was only to show that Tamaki was right and she won't always be able to win every fight. \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

He and his older identical twin, Hikaru, are \"little devil\" type hosts who put on an act of \"forbidden brotherly love\" (with Kaoru as the uke) to draw in their clients. Unlike Tamaki, the Hitachiin brothers are wholly calculating in their customer relations; however, this is because of their deep dependency of each other and a reluctance to let anyone into their world. Hikaru and Kaoru share a deep emotional bond, which was forged through a lonely childhood and through the fact that no one could tell them apart without looking at the parting of their hair (Hikaru's hair parts to the right; Kaoru's parts to the left). Since Haruhi is the first person that can truthfully tell them apart, they greatly treasure her friendship. Haruhi has stated that Hikaru and Kaoru have their differences, despite being identical twins. Of the two, Kaoru is nicer, more mature, and considerate of others.\n\nTamaki was the one who coerced the brothers into joining the Host Club in their last year of middle school. Since they told him they would join if he could guess which one was Hikaru, Tamaki repeatedly followed them around, tossing out random guesses as to who was Hikaru and who was Kaoru. They finally crumbled, and decided to just try out the Host Club, which was their first step towards a greater exposure to a world outside of their own. Later in the manga, both Hikaru and Kaoru fall in love with Haruhi. In chapter 52, Kaoru takes Haruhi on a date to an amusement park; he tells her he loves her, and kisses her cheek, but gives up on her afterwards because his relationship with Hikaru is more important to him.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

This is due to her love of visual novel-type video games to a point that she sometimes confuses them with real life. Her fascination with Kyoya originated from her obsession with one such dating game. Still, her experience with dating sims causes her to be more aware of character development and a thickening plot.

He is also a loyal friend who is selfless to a fault, and suffers greatly trying to help his friends without a single thought to his own health. \n\r\nHe is also from the transmutation Nen group. He constantly strives to improve his Nen ability, developing many interesting techniques as time moves on.\n\r\nHe is also the third person to have a transmutation Nen as his father and grandfather also are transmutation Nen users.

            "description": "Gender: Male\r\nAge: 17 (beginning); 19 (current)\r\nHeight: 171 cm\r\nWeight: 59 kg\r\nBirthday: April 4\r\nZodiac: Aries\r\nHair color: blonde\r\nEye color: blue (1999); brown (manga & 2011); scarlet (when angered)\r\nBlood type: AB\r\nNen type: Conjuration; Specialization (when his eyes are Scarlet)\r\nAbilities: Holy Chain, Dowsing Chain, Chain Jail, Judgment Chain\n\r\nKurapika is a member of the Kurta tribe who were massacred by the Phantom Troupe (The Spiders) 4 years prior the Hunter exam. The Kurta tribe was an isolated group of people whose eyes would turn scarlet when angered or excited. These scarlet eyes were known to be beautiful, being one of the seven most beautiful in the world. Because of this, the Kurta tribe was constantly pursued and eventually massacred. The eyes of the tribe members were all taken away during the massacre. Kurapika is so far the only known survivor with a heart bent on revenge. He strives to have his revenge against the Phantom Troupe as well as recover the eyes of his tribe members.\n\r\nDespite having a heart full of hatred, Kurapika is very kind and loyal towards his friends. He is an extremely intelligent person but at the same time reckless. Kurapika is from the materialization nen group and from determination, increased the power of his nen ability to the point that it was formidable against the Phantom Troupe.\n\r\nKurapika can conjure a unique weapon \u2014 five chains that extend from each finger on his right hand. Some of the fingers were specially designed to deal vengeance on the Phantom Troupe. To increase his effectiveness against the formidable Phantom Troupe, Kurapika places strict Limitations on the usage of his chains. The purpose of the chain on Kurapika's index finger has yet to be revealed.\n\r\nKurapika's Techniques\n\r\nHoly Chain (\u7652\u3059\u89aa\u6307\u306e\u9396 \u30db\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3 The Healing Thumb Chain): Type Conjuration and Enhancement Shaped like a cross, it cures wounds by drawing from Enhancement abilities. When Kurapika is in his Specialist state, its ability is Enhanced and can heal serious injuries within seconds.\r\nChain Jail (\u675f\u7e1b\u3059\u308b\u4e2d\u6307\u306e\u9396 \u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30a4\u30eb The Restraining Middle Finger Chain): Type Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation Shaped like a hook, it wraps around Spiders and restricts their movement. Also forcefully causes its prisoners to enter Zetsu, shutting off their aura and preventing the use of Nen abilities. Escape from the Chain Jail is only possible through brute force. Kurapika imposed a limitation onto this chain, it can only be used to deal with members of the Phantom Troupe. If this condition is violated, Kurapika will die. This condition was needed in order to increase the strength of the ability.\r\nDowsing Chain (\u5c0e\u304f\u85ac\u6307\u306e\u9396 \u30c0\u30a6\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3 The Guiding Ring Finger Chain): Type Conjuration Shaped like a ball and chain, Kurapika uses this frequently under normal situations, for defensive and offensive purposes. It is also useful for other investigative activities, like determining the location of missing individuals. He also uses this chain to identify if someone is lying. It has a small ball-like weight at the end which moves in the direction of whatever he is dowsing for.\r\nJudgment Chain (\u5f8b\u3059\u308b\u5c0f\u6307\u306e\u9396 \u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30b8\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3 The Arbiter Little Finger Chain): Type Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation \u200bThe Stake of Retribution, a blade on the end of the Judgment Chain, enters the victim's body and wraps around the heart. Kurapika sets two conditions and if the victim violates either one, the chain crushes the heart, killing them. It can only be used while Kurapika's eyes are scarlet. Kurapika himself has a blade wrapped around his heart, which he used to set the conditions of use for his Chain Jail ability.\r\nEmperor Time (\u7d76\u5bfe\u6642\u9593 \u30a8\u30f3\u30da\u30e9\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0 Absolute Mastery): Type Specialization When Kurapika's eyes shift into scarlet, he changes from a Conjurer to a Specialist. This ability allows him to utilize all the types of Nen to 100% efficiency (for a Conjurer). In the manga, Kurapika explains this using the terms \"Level\" and \"Force/Accuracy\". Kurapika's \"Levels\" in the various Nen categories remain the same during Emperor Time, however, his Force and Accuracy for every category is raised to 100%. Thus, if Kurapika's Level in Conjuration were 10, his Level in Emission (the polar opposite aura type) would be 4, and during Emperor Time, he would be evenly matched against a Level 4 Emitter at 100%. Outside of Emperor Time, his Force and Accuracy in Emission would at most be only be 40%."

His deviousness and volatility has made many opponents have difficulty anticipating his next move, and this has led to him winning many battles. Using Shu powered poker cards as his primary weapon, he throws them with ease and deadly accuracy.\n\r\nAlso, he is very intrigued by Gon and the potential this young boy has to become an adept and powerful adversary. Hisoka, ever looking for a strong opponent, is willing to aid, or at least not defeat prematurely, someone that could develop into a future opponent. \n\nDuring the Yorknew City arc, Hisoka is revealed to have recently replaced the fourth member of the Phantom Troupe, though his association with the organization is, rather characteristically, based on his drive to fight remarkable opponents. His main goal was to fight their leader, Chrollo, but his membership proved to be a farce, because he would never appear without other Troupe members, and rarely at that. This information is divulged in secret to Kurapika.\r\n(Source: HunterHunter Wikia, Japanese Wikipedia)"

Generally quiet, when he does speak, everybody listens. He is capable of commanding the attention of everybody around him with little effort. He seems to know quite a bit about events in The World R:2, though his quiet nature makes it unclear exactly how much knowledge he actually has. He frequently disappears from the game for long stretches of time; while he says it's related to his job in the real world, whether that is true or not is up for debate. As a Steam Gunner of an extremely high level, he has progressed beyond having to worry about trivial matters such as leveling or PKers, leaving him plenty of time to work on his long term goals, whatever they may be. One thing to note, though he never seems to lie, he has the habit of not giving a straight answer, leaving others to make their own judgments."

He is an outcast in real life, and not very good at dealing with people. Upon logging into The World R:2, Haseo is attacked by PKs, (Player Killers), and rescued by Ovan, the Guild master of the Twilight Brigade.\n\nHaseo then joins the Twilight Brigade in order to learn more about Ovan. Eventually, after Ovan disappears for an extended period of time, the Twilight Brigade is disbanded and Shino is PKed by Tri-Edge. Obsessed with saving Shino, Haseo continually seeks power, culminating in his journey into the Forest of Pain, a new Lost Ground, where, after confronting another AI Harald, his PC body was transformed.\n\nAt that point level 133 and equipped with an arsenal of incredibly powerful weapons, Haseo became the Terror of Death, a PKK, or Player Killer Killer, who hunted down Player Killers. Upon finding them, he demanded information on Tri-Edge; if they failed to give any useful information, which was usual, he killed them. The name Terror of Death was the title given to him by players, as he truly cared nothing for any other player except for Shino.\n\nAround this time, Ovan returns and informs Haseo that Tri-Edge will reappear shortly at the Hidden Forbidden Holy Ground. Haseo attempts to defeat Tri-Edge, but is Data-Drained, returning some time later as a level 1 character with no items or contact info.\n\n(AIDA- a bug in [The World R:2] that when normal players come into contact with this 'bug' they get their data altered/corrupted and if AIDA doesn't just infect the player the player will fall into a coma) \n(Ephitaph users- a select few with Avatars used to fight against Tri-Edge and AIDA among other 'bugs' or 'threats') \n(Avatar- a total of 8 creatures first seen in the original DotHack where Kite and his friend defeated them all, Avatars are now used by the Ephitaph users to 'delete' the bugs called AIDA or to remove these bugs from infected players, Avatars use a special move called data drain that when used on players with out an Avatar or AIDA inside them they will drop into a coma).\n\nWhile it is never officially announced wether they are the same person or not but Haseo has the same real name as well is close to the same age time wise as the player of Sora from .hack//sign as well as sharing a connection to skeith."

She had been living alone and her landlord discovered her unconscious. The doctors cannot treat her because they do not know the cause behind her coma. Those who have suffered fates like hers are referred to as a Lost One, since it is rumored that once PKed by Tri-Edge a player can never return to the game.

He is a very tall man of indeterminate age dressed in dark green leather armor. He wears a short brown cape and carries a round shield on his back. His face is the most distinctive part of his character, he wears an onion shaped helmet with goggles. Depending on his mood the goggles can flash different words or symbols at his command. When fighting, he summons a green bayonet, which he wields as a sword. Unlike most characters, he does not appear to have a visible wave symbol on his body or clothing. \r\nSakisaka has an interesting personality, he is very fond of using puns and other word games in everyday speech. He is generally a friendly helpful person, but he can also be very jealous and shows signs of having a bit of a temper. To those he considers friends he is one of the most helpful people you could meet, but to people who have offended him he is almost impossibly disagreeable. He is closest to Tabby who considers him her role model. \n\r\nIn the real world Sakisaka is a 19 year old man named Shinnosuke Sakamuki. He mentioned once that he lived in a cramped apartment with few windows."

He is a young silver-haired boy clad in grey robes,  At the start of the series, he is seen waking up to find himself in a dungeon in The World, but he has no idea why he is there or who he is. Not much time passes until Tsukasa discovers he is trapped in the game, unable to log out, while his real body is in a coma. He is initially depicted as a cynical loner who tends to avoid others as much as possible, but at the story progresses he begins to warm up to Mimiru, Bear, Subaru, and others.\n\nIn the real world, his name is An Shouji, and he happens to be a girl. She was raised by her father after the death of her mother, and was physically and mentally abused by him. His abusive behavior also distanced her from her gender: he treated her like a boy, refusing to allow her to use feminine products and basic hygiene products. There are also subtle hints that her father is an alcoholic. After awaking from her coma, Ryo Sakuma, the player behind Bear, becomes her legal guardian and allows her to go to a boarding school. She meets with Mariko, Subaru's player."

Luffy\r\nAge: 17; 19\r\nBirthdate: May 5, Taurus\r\nHeight: 172 cm; 174 cm\r\nBlood type: F\r\nAffiliation: Straw Hat Pirates\r\nPosition: Captain\r\nDevil fruit: Gomu Gomu no Mi (Gum Gum Fruit)\r\nType: Paramecia\r\nBounty:1,500,000,000 (previously; 30,000,000, 100,000,000, 300,000,000, 400,000,000 and 500,000,000)\n\r\nLuffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and is best friends with all of them and values them over all else. At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in a childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.\n\r\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D.\"\n\r\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism, and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he is intimidated at the mere mention of him.\n\r\nLuffy never kills any of his enemies, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or beating them to a point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.\n\r\nLuffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.\n\nMonkey D. Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army and the world's most wanted criminal. His grandfather is \"The Hero of The Marines,\" Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp.\n\r\nBefore the start of the series, Dragon left Luffy in Garp's care. Dragon first appears after a lightning bolt suddenly destroys the gallows where Luffy was to be executed by Buggy the Clown and then saves Luffy from being captured by Captain Smoker. When he saved Luffy from Smoker, a mighty gust of eerie wind swept through Loguetown. It is undetermined whether or not he was the cause of the gust of wind or the lightning; however, the story leads to believe there is more to him than it seems. Recently, he has taken over an island in the South Blue and is about to head to the North Blue when he commented, after noticing Luffy's newest bounty, given to him after invading Enies Lobby, that father and son will meet sometime soon."

Sven's outlook is much calmer and more logical than Train's; he often has to use his brain to win battles since he doesn't possess the Black Cat's pure physical power. He follows a strict \"gentlemen's code\", which often makes him seem older to other characters. \n\nThe Forseeing Eye (under the eyepatch) allows him to glimpse into the future at the cost of great mental strain.

She was raised to be emotionless, and as a result something that is considered normal is new to her.\n\r\nIn the anime, she first meets Sven and Train when Sven had wanted to save her while the Chronos has sent Train to kill her and destroy all the research data used in her creation, choosing to spare her life being one of the reasons Train left the organization. In the anime she is driven berserk by her creator and ordered to attack Train, while in the manga Eve first Encounters Train and Sven as they are working as sweepers to capture Torneo Rudman (Train having never been sent by Chronos in the Manga), she is rescued by Sven and Train and Train stops Toreno from causing Eve to go Berserk. She then joins Sven and Train.\n\r\nAt the beginning of the anime series Eve is wary of Train claiming he smells like blood,having given Train the bell he wears on his neck after reading that bells allow you to know where a bad cat is. Where as in the manga he already had his choker bell chain. They eventually develop into rivals over the position of being Sven's partner and Train gives her the nickname \"Little Princess\".\n\r\nHer hobby is reading books of varying degree of difficulty; she can memorize any book she reads after reading it once, usually confusing the others by using complicated words she's learned, and her power to transform becomes more refined the more she learns."

Himiko's average fighting skills meant that she often bites off more than what she can chew. In such situations, Ban can be counted on to come to her aid (though it must be noted that she does return the favor at times).\n\r\nIn the GB duo, he's often the one who thinks of plans for their moves. Initially, Ginji was seen to be a sidekick to him. (In fact, when they first formed their partnership, Ban insisted that Ginji was only his sidekick.) As the story progresses, Ginji gradually held his own in their missions, and Ban acknowledged him as an equal.\n\r\nBan is feared due to his procession of the Jagan, a power which allows him to make anyone he makes eye contact with to watch a one minute long illusion, however, it should only be used three times per day. The Evil Eye cannot be used on the same person again for the next 24 hours. Furthermore, while the illusion only lasts for one minute, should Ban will it, the one affected by the Jagan can be placed inside a time-warp zone via the illusion created by the technique, meaning that to them, one minute in real life could last up to several hours in the Jagan's influence. \n\r\nBecause he is a direct descendant of the Witch clan, and being born under the star of Asclepius, he possesses incredible superhuman strength, which gives him a gripping force of 200 kgf (2 kN) in each hand. It is also shown that he is strong enough break open the doors of an armored steel truck and punch hard enough to create large craters in the ground or break walls; occasionally even collapsing multi-storied buildings.\n\r\nAt full power, his right hand becomes a snake's claw that can crush anything. Also, while powering up, the astral outline of a giant snake can be seen surrounding him. The general impression of people when taking their first look at him is of a skinny or ordinary person; however, a close look will reveal that he is of a fair height and has solid shoulders and large, muscular and solid arms. His unruly ordinary appearance often deceive enemies and they don't expect his level of superhuman super strength."

He received the title \"Raitei\" (literally, \"Lightning Emperor\") because of his ability to control electricity. This control grants him several unique abilities such as amazing regenerative power as well as the ability to become a human magnet and battery. Despite Ginji's dark past, his demeanor is one of an unassuming, energetic, and friendly boy with a strong sense of justice. He makes friends easily, often without trying\u2014and is trusting and open to an almost naive extent. But when exposed to remnants of his past, he has a tendency to revert to his darker \"Raitei\" persona. For comical purposes, he also turns into a droopy chibi, most likely designed after a tare panda. He's frequently beaten up by Ban (comically) for doing stupid things.\n\r\nLittle of his past is known. We do know that his childhood guardian is Teshimine Takeru, then ruler of the Infinity Fortress. Before his departure, Ginji founded \"Volts,\" a gang lead by The Lightning Lord, and \"The Four Emperor of the Volts\" to protect the Infinity Fortress from the monsters of the Beltline."

Kazuki is the one to go for if you want information on just about anything; chances are, he knows all of your secrets, too. He keeps in close contact with Shido and Ginji, but he doesn't usually work with them. Kazuki fights with strings, as one might expect from the Fuuchouin String Style; there are a great many elusive fragments of this art that can't be traced. However, it is an incredibly flexible skill -- he can overhear conversations that take place in the presence of one of his strings, change his physical appearance and voice, sew people's mouths and eyes shut."

Once Volts disbanded, Shido left the Infinity Fortress to make a living outside, like Ginji. After reconciling with Ginji (whom he felt had betrayed Volts by leaving the Infinity Fortress), Shido took a cue from the Get Backers and started his own retrieval service - occasionally aided by Emishi. He is very independent and cold to others. Even though his powers allow him to control animals, he considers them friends, and tries to protect them as they do him. He eventually ends up living with Otowa Madoka, and he has an ongoing rivalry with Ban; he calls Ban \"snake bastard\" (\"Snake-for-Brains\" in the anime) while Ban's retort is often \"saru-mashi\" (monkey boy) or, due to to his stay with Madoka, \"pimp\".\n\r\nIn Volts, Shido is paired with Kurusu Masaki to protect the East Gates of the Infinity Fortress. Due to this, he knows a lot about Masaki and his followers, although it is doubted he knows about Masaki's true identity as a vassal for the Voodoo King. He remarks that Masaki has changed a lot from what he used to be , 'a man who will protect the weak.'"

In the anime, she has amazing ping-pong skills and even once takes on one of the Get Backers' clients while they are busy with another case (despite her lack of skill at anything besides table tennis, shogi, and cooking. Notable here is that she chose to wear an outfit consisting of Ban's shirt and glasses, and Ginji's pants and gloves for the case.) Sort of the GetBackers' unofficial groupie, Natsumi is very devoted to Ban and Ginji, often worrying about their welfare and staying up late at the Honky Tonk to welcome them back from a mission (This is also seen in the MV of the first ending theme in the anime, although the duo were just away to get groceries on a rainy day. Also, the song is sang by Otoha, Natsumi's seiyu). In a case of real life mirroring art, in the anime, Natsumi once teamed up with Emishi on a retrival mission (the same episode where she wore the outfit mentioned above); her seiyu (Otoha) later married a comedian."

With his attire (black hat and coat, complete with shirt and black tie) and polite manners, he could be mistaken for a harmless person. But for those who even remotely heard of his name, they know that the Jackal is possibly the most evil transporter to ply his trade ever. Entertainment is his main goal, not money; he is mainly a hedonist and the jobs he takes are chosen exclusively his own for amusement. He likes to decapitate his enemies while engaging them in battle, a practice that many of the other characters see as going too far. Indeed, the other characters (notably Midou Ban and Amano Ginji) do not like him because of his other habit of cutting up anything which stands between him and his goal, whether man or beast. (In his own words, he is a \"consummate professional.\")"

Only his last name, Makube, is known, for it was written on the bag itself. He later came to be known as MakubeX, the 'x' symbolizing an unknown variable, and his \"name\" is always written in romaji. MakubeX is a genius hacker, capable of manipulating computers to do whatever he pleases. He was originally taught by Gen but swiftly surpassed him in skill.\n\r\nHe was raised by Gen, whom he calls Grandfather, but left home to join the VOLTS. During the VOLTS's rule of Infinity Fortress, he was one of the \"Four Kings\", alongside Shido Fuyuki, Fuuchouin Kazuki, and Masaki Kurusu. After Ginji Amano left the fortress, he, as the only one of the Four Kings remaining, took over, instituting a dictatorial rule; he was known at this period as the \"young demon king\".\n\r\nDuring the 'Infinity Fortress' arc, the GetBackers are hired to retrieve the mysterious 'IL' from him. It is later discovered that IL is in fact a computer disc containing important data required for producing an atomic bomb. (however, IL is also a short form for \"implosion lens\", one of the most crucial parts of an implosion-type nuclear weapon). The arc ends with his reconciliation with Ginji, who acknowledges the transfer of power.\n\r\nMakubeX's second-in-command is Sakura Kakei. In the IL arc, his four chief subordinates were Juubei Kakei, Haruki Emishi, Takuma Fudo, and Kyoji Kagami; Fudou vanished afterwards, but Juubei and Emishi remained with him. In the manga, after the Divine Design arc, Toshiki Uryuu came under him; he assigned the newcomer to his old comrade, Juubei."

A witty old man, his advancing age has not dampened his quick thinking and speed in battle. Zeno wears alternating signs on his garb that say either \"A Kill A Day\" or \"Never Retire.\" He appears to be on good terms with the Hunter Committee's Chairman, Netero, who hired Zeno to assault Ming Jol-ik's palace in East Gorteau in order to catch the chimera ant King off guard. Zeno favors Killua more than his other grandchildren, most likely because Killua is the heir of the family.\n\nSource: HunterXHunter.wikia"

She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency)  since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by the eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit's power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. \n\r\nRobin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.\n\r\nRobin is actually an archaeologist of talent, and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons, and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.\n\r\nRobin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat's Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world, and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool. This trait makes her different from the other Straw Hats, who often comically react melodramatically to unexpected happenings and hold irrational ideas and conclusions. Despite her attempts to keep herself distant, Robin has fallen for her new friends, and has taken the role of the distant den mother."

            "description": "Name: Roronoa Zoro\r\nAge: 19; 21\r\nBirthdate: November 11, Scorpio \r\nHeight: 178 cm (5'10\") , 181 (5'11\") (after timeskip)\r\nAffiliation: Straw Hat Pirates\r\nPosition: Swordsman\r\nDevil Fruit: None\r\nBounty: 320,000,000 (previously: 60,000,000 and 120,000,000)\n\r\nZoro was the first crew member to be recruited by Luffy. Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style).This is achieved by using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head. \n\r\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood.\n\r\nZoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but, unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.\n\r\nZoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined."

She is evidently Edward's love interest. Specializing in mechanical repair, specifically with automail, Winry services Edward's arm and leg whenever it is in need of repair or replacement.\n\nIn the manga, Winry becomes an apprentice to Garfiel, an automail engineer in Rush Valley. She also studies techniques for making automail for northern frigid conditions. Her parents, both doctors, were killed by Scar during the Ishbal war when she was very young. In chapter 47 at the Central, she tried to shoot Scar after finding out that he was the one who had killed her parents.\n\r\nShe frequently travels with the Elrics in earlier chapters and later, returning back to Rush Valley, realizes that she has been in love with Ed for a long time, and Ed has the same feeling though he constantly denies it.\n\r\nIt has been mentioned in chapter 15 that Alphonse and Edward had once fought over who would get to marry Winry when they were kids, making Ed freak out and become incredibly flustered, claiming that he didn't remember that. Alphonse won, but was rejected. After Ed asked her why, she replied with \"I don't like guys shorter than me,\" resulting in a huge blow on Ed's ego.\n\nDue to her importance in the lives of the Elric brothers, Winry is used as a hostage by the military to gain Edward's obedience. In order to escape from the military possession, she decided to travel with Scar and the others. It was revealed in chapter 73 that it was her plan for Scar to use her as a hostage in order to escape although she has not forgiven him for killing her parents. In chapter 84 Winry is taken on a military train back into Resembool in a water tank. When she goes into her house, she is shocked to find Ed in her room while she is undressing. They both scream which causes everyone to believe that the two of them are in danger. Shortly afterwards (after beating his head a few times), she fills Ed in on where Al is and what have been happening in Lior. Ed tells her to leave the country, but she refuses, wanting to help Ed in any way that she can. Ed soon departs, and Winry stays in Resembool for the time being.\n\r\nAt the epilogue, Ed confesses (or maybe more like proposes) to her, and in a photo, it shown that they're married and have two children."

He first appeared in the Water 7 arc. Franky is one of \"Tom's Workers\", with original name \"Cutty Flam.\"\n\r\nFranky's dream is to build a ship that would travel to the end of the Grand Line. This is the ship that the Straw Hats are currently riding, but his dream is not yet achieved until they make it to the end.\n\r\nFranky usually acts tough and is quickly angered, but he is also very emotional when it comes to sad tales and often bursts into large tears, or on some occasions, plays a song. His most distinguishable personality trait is his flamboyant attitude. He frequently shouts the word 'SUPER' when he's in a positive mood, or adds it into his speech. He also has a signature pose which he uses very often.\n\r\nFranky is quick to defend other people (e.g. Franky Family, Nico Robin) and take action if his friends are harmed. He is also quick in making friends, allies, and comrades with even the most unlikely of individuals. Because of this, he is seen as a 'big brother' figure. Monkey D. Luffy bears similar qualities (with the exception of engaging in unnecessary fights) and because of this, despite the disputes the two had in the past, both grew to respect each other during the events of the Enies Lobby Arc."

She expands their training with a regimen of philosophy, martial arts, and living off the land. Her methods are derived from her own alchemy training: in the manga and second anime, she was forced to survive in the northern region surrounding Briggs Fortress for a month (although it turns out she succeeded by stealing supplies from the northern fortress), whereas in the first anime she was taught by Dante. She thinks of the Elrics as her own sons, and although she severs her student-teacher ties with them after learning of their attempts with human transmutation (and similarly Ed's joining the State Military), she continues to do all she can to help them. She can be quite violent when punishing or sparring with the Elric brothers, so they tend to be deathly afraid of her. Her claim of \"I'm a housewife!\" while confronting Greed was a favorite scene of Arakawa's to draw.\n\nIzumi and her husband Sig Curtis (\u30b7\u30b0\u30fb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9, Shigu K\u0101tisu) were expecting a child years before the start of the series; however, their son was stillborn. Izumi tried and failed to revive the child through human transmutation (an act that created Wrath in the first anime). The failed attempt took some of her internal organs, resulting in infertility, and causing her to periodically cough up blood. Izumi gained the ability to use alchemy without a transmutation circle after seeing the \"truth.\"\n\nIn the manga, Izumi attracts the attention of the State Military for surviving the failed human transmutation. As she and her husband travel around Amestris in order to avoid the military, they eventually meet Ed and Al's father Hohenheim. He rearranges her insides to ease the blood flow, and persuades her to help collaborate in bringing down the State Military."

Using special gloves that create a spark when he snaps his fingers, Roy can create anything from a tiny ember to burn a letter, to a raging inferno that can destroy a humanoid body in seconds. His precise control over the alchemically enhanced flame is so accurate that he can boil the water in a persons' eyes and can also attack enemies amongst a riot without hurting any allies.\n\r\nOutwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and almost always one step ahead of his opponents, and likes to feel in control of the situation. He is one of the superiors of Edward Elric. On the surface, he appears to be nothing more than a man of the military who pursues promotions and praise and is considered a ladies' man who constantly goes on dates with different women. Mustang's true goal is to become F\u00fchrer in order to gain the power to reform the government in order to absolve his sins in the Ishval War as well as change the country for the better, along with the joking requirement for female officers to wear tiny miniskirts (which considerably increased Havoc's loyalty to him and caused Hawkeye to be angry with him). \n\r\nHis goals are admirable enough that he earns the fierce loyalty of his good friends Lt Col. Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, and his own subordinates, among whom are Riza Hawkeye, Jean Havoc, Heymans Breda, Vato Falman, and Kain Fuery. While Mustang has a close and amicable relationship with all of his subordinates, he appears to share a deeper bond of affection with his second-in-command Riza Hawkeye, who has devoted her life to supporting him. This bond culminates in the final episodes of the anime when Mustang chooses Hawkeye alone to accompany him on his greatest and most dangerous mission. \n\r\nThough a hero of the Ishval War, he remains haunted by the horrors of war and suffers great remorse for the lives he took. \n\nAfter the Promised Day arrives, he is forced to open the gate by Pride and Wrath, they first try to make him do it voluntarily by reviving Hawkeye, but he refuses. So Pride opens the gate for him using his Philosopher's Stone. Mustang gains the power to transmute without a circle, however his price is his eyesight.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Maes would do anything for his wife Gracia and always carries pictures of his daughter Elycia in his uniform and never misses a chance to show everyone how cute she is. He starts out in the anime as a Major in the Investigation Division and eventually becomes a Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nHe is killed by Envy upon his discovery of Father's plans, and is posthumously promoted to Brigadier General after his death."

She carries out many of the tasks he is too lazy to do, acts as his personal assistant, and protects him from danger. She also doubles as his voice of reason, keeping cool in heated situations and scolding him when he allows his emotions to get in the way. Riza and Roy seem to share a close relationship in both adaptations of Fullmetal Alchemist; in the anime she identifies him as her most precious person, whereas in the manga she loses her resolve to live when believing he has been killed. Riza specializes in firearms, particularly sniper rifles, and can hit nearly any target with lethal accuracy. She adopts a dog, called Black Hayate in both the anime and the manga, which she raises with stern discipline; when Hayate goes to the bathroom inside, she shoots at the wall behind him to reinforce that doing so is bad."

He never shows his face to the world, instead of representing himself with a capital L in Cloister Black font. After meeting the Kira investigation team, he requests that the task force refers to him as Ryuzaki for discretion. The Kira investigation team never learns his true name.\n\r\nL's disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. He tends to second-guess everything he is presented with and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He has several quirks such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods like desserts and fruits, and holding items very delicately. He stayed in England for five years, and during that time he was the champion in tennis for the England Junior Cup.\n\r\nL suggests that even though he eats only sweet foods, he remains underweight because the brain uses the most calories of any organ in the body. He also says that if he sits normally, his reasoning ability would drop 40%.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, Death Note Profiles)"

Azuma also has solar hands, exceptionally warm hands that allow the yeast to ferment faster and better when he is making his bread.

He gets his inspirations for his ja-pan from random sources, like other Japanese foods and stories from his experienced but over-talkative grandfather, a rice farmer.

A Harvard graduate like Kuroyanagi, he looks up to him as a mentor, calling him 'Senpai'(which means Senior). He is considered as a \"Harvard Junior Genius\", having graduated the prestigious school at a very young age of sixteen. Originally working for Tsukino's evil sister Yukino Azusagawa, Kanmuri defected to the Pantasia's Southern Tokyo store to work with Azuma after Yukino blew up his research laboratory as a result of him losing to Azuma. He remained to keep the store throughout the Monaco Cup, but rejoined the team for the Yakitate!! 25/Yakitate!! 9 challenge. Recently revealed to be one out of the last two possible heirs to the Hashiguchi Company (the biggest gangster organization in Japan). Although he firmly states that he'd never join the Yakuza, problem sets as the other heir, Masanobu Tsutsumi, Shigeru's half-brother, shares the same sentiments. Tsutsumi is jealous at his half-brother for getting all the attention from their father, thus fueling his own determination to defeat the younger boy in a cooking/baking competition. This problem is promptly settled with a one-on-one battle in Yakitate!!25/Yakitate!! 9 (refer to Episode 62). He is probably named after a Shogakukan editor of the same name.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

At first glance he doesn't stack up to bread makers like Kawachi and Azuma, but Kageto seems to have the strange ability to work so fast it looks like there are several of him at once as well as actually making clones of himself. This is because he was raised up in a family that works in a circus. He can also copy another's bread-making skills 95% as good as the original. Kinoshita also possesses the ability to sense if other people are talking about him elsewhere. He often writes to his mother, who apparently, lives elsewhere, telling her about whatever happens at Pantasia.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

            "description": "Age: 26-27 (Part I); 29-31 (Part II)\r\nBirthday: September 15\r\nHoroscope: Virgo\r\nBlood Type: O\r\nHeight: 5\"11\"\r\nWeight: 67.5 kg \r\nHair: Silver\r\nEyes: Grey, Sharingan\r\nRank: Jonin, Former ANBUHokage\r\nLikes: Icha-Icha series, Broiled Saury with salt, Miso soup with eggplant\r\nDislikes: Anything sweet\r\nQuote: (from Obito) \"A shinobi who violates the rules is scum, but a shinobi who abandons their friends is worse than scum\".\n\r\nMajor Background SpoilersLike his father, Sakumo Hatake whose skills have been compared to that of the Legendary Ninja, Kakashi is considered a genius shinobi, graduating from the Ninja Academy at age 5 and achieving the rank of Chunin at 6. A few years after these accomplishments, Kakashi's father was disgraced by the village for abandoning a mission in favor of saving his comrades, which cost the Land of Fire dearly. Deeply ashamed and ostracized even by those he had saved, Sakumo committed seppuku, leaving Kakashi to bear witness to the event. After his father's suicide, Kakashi began to adhere strictly to the rules of the shinobi \u2013 in particular the rule dictating that the success of the mission must come before the well being of one's teammates, causing him to become arrogant, humorless, and by-the-book.\n\r\nDuring an attempt to save Rin, Kakashi lost his left eye as a result of taking an enemy ninja's attack for Obito. To protect Kakashi in return, Obito managed to awaken his Sharingan and killed their assailant. Soon after saving Rin, a rockfall technique was triggered and a rock struck Kakashi on his blind side. He would have been buried beneath the rocks had Obito not pushed Kakashi out of the way, getting the right side of his body almost completely crushed in the process. Shortly before he died, Obito had Rin (a medical ninja) implant his Sharingan eye in Kakashi's damaged eye socket as a gift. As his first act with his new eye, Kakashi avenged Obito by killing the enemy ninja with his now-perfected Chidori technique, bringing the Kakashi of today into being.\n\r\nYears later Kakashi would become a member of the Konohagakure ANBU where he served as a squad leader. During this time, he had several k\u014dhai, named Yugao Uzuki and Tenzo, and recognized the latter as the most successful of his k\u014dhai. It is unknown when or why he left ANBU, but he still wears iron guards on his gloves, a characteristic of ANBU uniforms.\n\r\nObito's death profoundly changed Kakashi, and Kakashi adopted many of Obito's traits. One such trait was Obito's concept of teamwork, which is most clearly seen in the way Kakashi tests newly-graduated students hoping to become a squad under him. He uses the bell test to test his students, which requires the three students to get the two bells he keeps on his person. Only those who get a bell get to pass, which would be difficult even with teamwork, as at least one ninja would fail regardless. However, the rule is only a ruse; the point of the test is to foster teamwork and to teach the students that teamwork is more important than the rules. Team 7 is the only team to realize this, and as such becomes the only team Kakashi passes into Genin-status. Kakashi also inherits Obito's chronic tardiness, due primarily to losing track of time during his frequent visits to Konoha's memorial site, where Obito's name is engraved. Ironically, this very habit is one that Kakashi was often annoyed at Obito about. Obito was supposedly late due to random good deeds. Kakashi's personal life appears to be as much of a mystery as the face behind the mask he has worn for most of his ninja career. He has no living family, or at least none he cares to acknowledge, and he's confirmed that everyone he loves is already dead.\r\nKakashi has an ongoing, albeit slightly one-sided, rivalry with Might Guy, with Guy constantly proclaiming that Kakashi is his rival, and considering his and Kakashi's subordinates rivals. Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and Kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. Given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on Guy's part. Nevertheless, Guy is proud of his record.\n\r\nThough he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"Icha Icha Paradise\" (\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally \"Make Out Paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally \"Make Out Violence\"). In Part II Naruto gives him the new \"Icha Icha Tactics\" (\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30bf\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally \"Make Out Tactics\").\n\r\nKakashi's Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent's movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi's use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. In Part II Kakashi is able to develop his own Mangekyo Sharingan. With his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another's arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. Much like the standard Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan tires Kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.\n\r\nWith his Sharingan Kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\". As a result, Kakashi's arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. Many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. He does, however, use Water Release: Water Encampment Wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. He less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique to attack opponents or Earth Release: Inner Decapitation Technique (\u571f\u9041\u30fb\u5fc3\u4e2d\u65ac\u9996\u306e\u8853, Doton: Shinj\u016b Zanshu no Jutsu, Viz \"Groundhog Technique Decapitation\", English TV \"Headhunter Jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. He can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks Naruto's chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.\n\r\nWhile Kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his Sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique (\u9b54\u5e7b\u30fb\u5948\u70d9\u898b\u306e\u8853, Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. A Thousand Years of Pain (death in english dub) (\u5343\u5e74\u6bba\u3057, Sennen Goroshi) consists of Kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent's rectum. While only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.\n\r\nWhen he was younger Kakashi was taught how to use the Rasengan by the Fourth Hokage. Because the Rasengan is meant to have the user's chakra nature mixed with it, Kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In time he instead created the Chidori, his only original jutsu. After the jutsu's initial creation Kakashi was unable to use the Chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. After acquiring the Sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. Through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, Kakashi's Chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the Lightning Blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it."

Kino travels with the motorrad, Hermes. The two have a contract\u2014Kino provides the balance, Hermes provides the speed, and together they can travel anywhere they wish. Kino is an excellent marksman with deadly speed and accuracy, and is typically armed with two large-caliber pistols. On the journeys with Hermes, they both try and stay neutral to the situations they come across and avoid getting into other people's business.\n\nIt is revealed in episode 4 of the anime and the final chapter of volume 1 of the light novel series that Kino is a female. Her name \"Kino\" is actually the name of the traveler who saved her as a child and caused her to take to her current lifestyle. Her actual birth name is left unstated throughout both the show and LN but there are implications in the anime that it is \"Sakura.\""

He is also rather gullible, trusting Kino absolutely even when Kino is teasing him, which leads him to grumble and complain some more. Perhaps his most famous line is \"I'm bored.\" The motorrad is in many ways naive and innocent, and acts very child-like, which tends to be a sharp contrast to Kino's more mature and worldly bearing. Still, Hermes is quite reliable and makes a good companion for long trips.\n\r\nIn the Gakuen Kino off-shot series, he takes the form of a cell phone strap instead.\n\r\n(Source: kino.ming-ling.net)"

He is the son of Gendo and the late Yui Ikari. Abandoned by his father, Gendo, when he was a toddler, Shinji often ran away from difficult situations. As a pilot, he panics easily and reacts very poorly to unexpected events. Over time and with encouragement from Misato, he learns to be less cowardly, more outspoken, and more confident.\n\nHis progress is all undone when he is forced to kill the only person who ever openly expressed love toward him. His only friends are Toji and Kensuke, but he apparently cares about Rei more than even he realizes, although everyone around him seems to think that his feelings are obvious. Despite his rapport with Rei, Asuka is a sexual presence in his life, and is ultimately shown to be a figure of great emotional importance to him as well. Though not immediately apparent, their relationship is a powerful driving force for both characters throughout the series. Their confused, back-and-forth emotional interchanges are a source of considerable guilt and tension for both parties. While Asuka is attracted to Shinji, she is afraid to admit to being dependent on anyone; so instead of expressing affection, she teases Shinji (often with sexual overtones), hoping to \"provoke\" him into initiating a closer relationship. Significantly, she gives him his first kiss (supposedly out of boredom, though the Director's Cut makes clear that the kiss meant a lot more to her than she lets on). However, due to his own emotional issues, Shinji is unable to recognize Asuka's actions for their true intent, and is only confused and hurt by her flirting mixed with abuse. \n\r\nSince Asuka is constantly heaping him with accusations and blame, his most natural response is to withdraw and hide himself, both emotionally and literally. To make matters worse, Asuka only finds herself more and more frustrated by Shinji's failure to respond to her advances, and in turn only abuses him more and more harshly, which only makes him withdraw further, thus continuing the vicious cycle. Their tense relationship reaches a breaking point toward the end of the story; when Asuka's stress finally causes her to degrade into a completely withdrawn state, Shinji tries to comfort her, only to be coldly rejected.\nLater on, when Asuka has further been reduced to a comatose state and Shinji has also suffered incredible mental duress, he goes to her bedside to beg for help, only to end up masturbating over her partially nude (and comatose) body. Wracked with guilt and completely lost to his own self-hatred, he enters a completely withdrawn state, not unlike Asuka's earlier on.\n\r\nUltimately, when Shinji chooses to reject Instrumentality, he finds Asuka to be the only other person on Earth, and they painfully reconcile.\r\n(Source: Afufu)"

An important factor in the development of Hikaru's passion for Go was an encounter early on where Hikaru becomes the rival of Akira Toya. At first, he thinks that Go is just for oldsters and he is annoyed at Sai's demand to play, but little by little his passion for Go increases as he plays more and more. From being a member of a school Go club to being an insei and finally becoming a professional Go player (at 14 years old) a year after Akira, Hikaru matures throughout the course of the series. Throughout the series, Hikaru gradually gets taller because the manga volumes are around when he is getting older and playing Go at the same time. Hikaru is often portrayed wearing clothing having the numeral \"5\". This is a pun on the Japanese common name for five: go. His birthday is September 20th. Part of his strength is his ability to read far into the game very fast, and to make seemingly stupid moves. These moves in fact lure the opponent to doing stupid moves, which Hikaru then traps them by."

            "description": "A spirit from the Heian era of Japan and mentor of Hikaru Shindo. Sai continually plays Go in attempt to one day play the divine move (also known as the Hand of God). In the manga and anime, Sai had possessed the real-life figure Hon'inbo Shusaku and through his body, became a renowned Go player. Sai holds a rivalry towards Koyo Toya (a.k.a. Toya Meijin) and through Hikaru persuades Toya to have a game with him.\n\nHis wish is realized when Toya accepts the challenge and plays a game through the Internet. After a legendary match that ends up with Sai's triumph, Hikaru discovers another move which would have turned the game around. Witnessing the maturity of Hikaru, Sai finds out that his one-thousand-year time in the world is going to finish and can't fulfill the wish of obtaining the divine move. A few days after the game with Toya Meijin, Sai suddenly disappears, neither terminating his last match with Hikaru nor saying goodbye to him. Sai leaves Hikaru forever, leaving Hikaru depressed and wanting to quit go. Hikaru then realizes that he will continue to play go for Sai since Sai influenced him to play go.\r\nExtremely effeminate by today's standards (as is appropriate for a high-born Heian man), Sai is often drawn with traditionally feminine features and mannerisms. Yumi Hotta has joked about fans mistakenly calling him a \"she\" in the \"intermission\" pages of the manga. Sai's extremely emotional behavior is also proper for a Heian male; he sometimes cries copiously, soaking his long sleeves with tears, which in his own time would be respected as a sign of intelligence and sensitivity. His name Fujiwara indicates that he is related to a noble family of extremely high prestige in the Heian period, the Fujiwara clan."

She is from Germany, but with an American father and a half-German, half-Japanese mother. In the Rebuild of Evangelion series of movies, her name is changed to Asuka Langley Shikinami.\n\nHer mother, Kyoko Zeppelin Souryuu, went insane after an Eva-related experiment and began to believe that a doll that resembled Asuka was, in fact, her daughter, to the point that she refused to acknowledge the real Asuka. Kyoko Zeppelin Souryuu committed suicide on the very day that Asuka was chosen to become an Eva pilot. On that day, Asuka promised herself that she would never cry again. This event gives her an innate hatred of dolls and all things that she perceives to be doll-like, especially Rei. Despite those feelings Asuka shows no hesitation when required to cooperate with Rei when necessary, proving her to be committed and professional regarding her duties as an Eva pilot.\n\r\nAsuka's father later remarried a woman for whom Asuka feels no affection. Asuka feels the need to verbally and sometimes physically lash out at everyone around her, except to her unrequited crush, Kaji, who is Misato's ex-boyfriend and more than twice Asuka's age. On her better days, however, she can be quite cheerful and friendly.\n\r\nLike Shinji, Asuka also has a difficulty being close to people, except unlike Shinji, who shells himself, Asuka's coping mechanism is over-aggressiveness and so she unintentionally hurts people she likes, pushing them away and thus sinking further into loneliness and self resentment. This issue is referred to as the \"hedgehog's dilemma\" and is a recurring motif in the story."

He along with Kimihiro has graduated from Haze Middle School. Tetsuo smokes cigarettes, which were kept in the earlier U.S. Shonen Jump versions of Hikaru no Go, but were removed from the U.S. graphic novels and the later (as of 2005) Shonen Jump versions.

Heero is known as \"The Perfect Soldier,\" having been trained since he was very young for the battlefield.\n\r\nHeero Yuy is nothing more than his code name, however, named for the fallen Colony leader who's assassination the Gundam Pilots were supposed to avenge.\n\r\nAfter his arrival on Earth, Heero encounters Relena Darlian, the daughter of an Earth/Colony peace advocate. After enrolling in her school, Heero ends up saving her life on several occasions, causing him to confuse his mission and his feelings.\n\r\nHeero's first ally is Duo Maxwell, who helps him pull his Gundam up from the ocean. Afterwards, he sets out on his own for a while, attacking bases and OZ encampments.\n\r\nHis primary rival is Zechs Merquise, and they have several battles throughout the series, even trading Gundams from time to time. His other rival is Treize Kushrenada, who gives him the purely evil Gundam Epyon, which he trades to Zechs for the Wing Zero.\n\r\nAlthough Trowa Barton holds the most mystery to his personality, Heero comes a close second, always disappearing after completing a mission or having an encounter. He lives by his emotions as stated by himself several times within the series and always thinks things through most of the time.  He was also referred to as \"the heart of space\" by Quatre Raberba Winner, Pilot 04, near the end of the last episode.  \n\r\nIn Frozen Teardrop\n\r\nAt an unspecified date, Heero is cryogenically frozen by Preventer  and stored at the Mars Preventer base. Given the code name 'Sleeping Beauty/Princess Aurora' due to the appearance of his capsule, he remains there for decades until he is awoken in MC (Mars Colony) 0022, when he is awoken to participate in Operation Mythos.\n\r\nAfter awakening, Heero is approached by Master Chang and Father Maxwell, who ask him to fight again in one last mission. For this purpose he becomes partners with Duo Maxwell and becomes the pilot of the 'Snow White', vowing to kill Relena once again. \n\r\n(Source: animefu.com)"

As a result, he is defeated in his next two games and loses his chance to become a pro. He later learns to control his emotions and passes the next year's pro exam without a single loss. Isumi also unknowingly helps Hikaru get over his loss of Sai when their practice game makes Hikaru realize that by playing, he can find Sai within his moves, the Go that Sai passed on to Hikaru.

His bragging about his strength hides his insecurity; after each loss he is known to disappear into the restroom for long periods of time. Akira tutors him to find out about Hikaru's current strength. Ochi is unnerved by Hikaru because Akira's obsession about him seems to suggest there is more to Hikaru than what Ochi knows. Ochi is also angry that Akira acknowledges Hikaru as a rival, but not Ochi himself. He demands that Akira view him as a rival if he can defeat Hikaru in the pro exam. Ochi loses to Hikaru, but does pass the pro exam. He comes from a wealthy family, as evidenced by the number of pros that come to his household to tutor him privately in go.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He first took notice of Hikaru when the latter explained a go move during a children's tournament that even professional Go players would take some time to see (which was actually Sai's doing) and later, as the rivalry between Hikaru and Akira emerged, catalyzed its development for several times, such as helping Hikaru to be accepted into the Insei test and occasionally reporting Hikaru's progress to an uninterested and disillusioned Akira. After the Net game between Touya Kouyo and Sai, Ogata also became obsessed with playing Sai and constantly nagged Hikaru. Unbeknownst to him, his request was finally granted just before Sai disappeared, during a game with Hikaru when he was too drunk to notice Sai was playing.\n\r\nOgata is one of the best young Go pros of Japan, having been the challenger for many titles throughout the series and finally winning the Gosei and Judan titles when Touya Kouyo retires. He's frequently after the Honinbo title Kuwabara currently holds and this sparks a rivalry between them. His birthday is January 17th."

He persists in offering his friendship to the initially hostile Heero, eventually winning his antisocial comrade's trust through sheer persistence. But despite his friendly nature, Duo earns his \"God of Death\" nickname when he takes on Alliance and OZ soldiers in battle.\n\r\nPrior to Operation Meteor, Duo was part of the spacegoing salvage organization known as the Sweeper Group, and on Earth he is assisted by the Sweepers' seafaring kinsfolk. When there is a lull in the fighting, Duo happily returns to his salvage-merchant's trade. He is distinguished by his black wardrobe, his yard-long plait and his minister's collar.\n\r\nIn Frozen Teardrop\n\r\nAfter Hilde breaks up with him in MC0012, Duo travels to Mars. Getting into a terrible motorbike accident in MC0014, most of his limbs are fractured, however he is aided by Trowa Barton. Once out of the hospital, saddled with debts, he meets Hilde again, who has become a librarian in the Lanigreen Republic. After moving in with her, he begins to work to earn money to fix his motorbike, and proposes to Hilde. The two are married in MC0015, and he cuts his braid off. However, he soon leaves again, taking off into the Martian wilderness. When he returns in MC0016, Hilde has become a nun at a local church orphanage. When the priest of the church bequeaths it to them, the debts of the church are also passed on to the two, as their assets were shared in marriage- the brunt of which fall to Hilde, and so she demands a divorce from Duo, who has also incurred many debts. He accepts the divorce, but not before promising to help pay off her debts. When he returns again in MC0017 NEXT SUMMER, he discovers a child whom is also named Duo Maxwell  and closely resembles him living at the orphanage, although it is not clear if the child is his biological son or not- he denies it aloud, but inwardly muses that the child would have been born in the time of his absence after marrying Hilde.\n\r\nDuring this time, he remains a close contact and ally of the Preventers. In MC0022 NEXT WINTER, he comes to the Mars Preventer base at the request of Master Chang, the head of the base, bringing the younger Duo, whom he refers to as his son, with him. He introduces himself as only 'Father Maxwell' to Preventer agent Kathy Po and reveals that he and Master Chang were once the legendary Gundam pilots named Duo Maxwell and Chang Wufei. He seems to have been training his son to take part in the upcoming Operation Mythos, and he and Duo are present for the reawakening of Heero Yuy from cold sleep, him being the first one to greet Heero upon his awakening."

When asked by his young look-alike Trowa Phobos  what the T in his name stands for, he first answers 'Trowa', but later concedes that it stands for 'Triton', confirming other series materials which indicate that Trowa is Catherine Bloom's long-lost brother."

He is the only son of a wealthy family of space colony builders, with 29 older sisters and a stern pacifist father who disapproves of his going into combat. Though Quatre himself abhors bloodshed, he feels compelled to fight to protect his loved ones.\n\r\nWhile Quatre lacks the fighting prowess and ruthlessness of his fellow Gundam pilots, he does have excellent family connections, almost unlimited cash, and a troop of forty loyal underlings at his disposal. His gentle personality quickly wins over his fellow Gundam pilot Trowa Barton, and he eventually becomes the de facto leader of the Gundam pilots.\n\r\nIn Frozen Teardrop\n\r\nAt some point between 10 and 20 years before MC0021, Quatre somehow acquires another, much younger sister, named Katherine Oud Winner. Along with Trowa Barton, who is working under the alias 'Dokter T', Quatre develops 4 new mobile suits for unknown purposes using his family's resources- Snow White, Warlock, Prometheus, and Scheherazade."

The truth is, that is not the case. Kokoro is understanding of Kippei's responsibility to spend most of his time with Yuzuyu.

Wufei adheres to a strict code of honor and justice, seeking to protect the weak and punish the guilty. But his pride is something of a weak point - when pushed too far, Wufei's huge ego has a tendency to break.\n\r\nUnlike the other Gundam pilots, even the relatively antisocial Heero and Trowa, Wufei prefers to operate alone and frequently seems to have a better idea what's going on than his blundering fellows. His only companion is his Gundam, which he calls \"Nataku\" after the Chinese mythological hero [see Episode Zero manga for more information].\n\r\nIn Frozen Teardrop\n\r\nBy M.C. 0022, Wufei has become the head of the Mars Preventer base. He is the direct superior officer of Kathy Po, whom he sends to Earth to meet with President Dorothy Catalonia and get important files in order to enact Operation Mythos. When Kathy arrives back at the base, Wufei uses the files to awaken Heero Yuy from cold sleep. He and Father Maxwell with his son Duo greet Heero once awoken and give him his mission."

As a child, Athrun attended a preparatory school on the moon, where he became good friends with Kira Yamato. Now, with his father leading the most warlike faction of the PLANT Supreme Council  and his mother among the casualties of the \"Bloody Valentine\" tragedy, Athrun is determined to defeat the treacherous Earth Alliance - and shocked to discover that Kira is fighting on the side of the enemy. Athrun has a talent for mechanical tinkering, and has created numerous robot pets for his friends and acquaintances.\n\nGundam SEED Destiny\n\nThe famous Athrun Zala took up residence in Orb after the end of the previous war, taking on the alias Alex Dino and assisting Cagalli as her aide and bodyguard. When he accompanies Cagalli to Armory One for a meeting with Chairman Durandal, Athrun is drawn into the new conflict, and with the fall of Junius Seven and the outbreak of full-scale war he decides to cast aside his false identity and return to the battlefield.\n\nOn the field of battle, Athrun Zala excels piloting just about anything. When he pilots a standard mobile suit ZAKU warrior (Phase 1), he is able to pilot it with immense skill and bravery. Noted for his skills, Durandal provides Athrun with Saviour, one of the new Gundams. He is extremely agile and fast and makes use of power, speed, and skill all at the same time. However, despite his improved skills, he cannot easily defeat enemy Gundam pilots such as the experimental Earth Alliance pilots. With that being said, although his skills in combat have a definite increase, they are not as skilled as that of Kira Yamato. After his Saviour is destroyed in battle with Freedom, Athrun gets the Infinite Justice and fights alongside Kira's Strike Freedom."

Near the beginning of the series she was engaged to Athrun Zala through an arranged marriage. Though (reporting to the drama CD) the two were in love when they first met, their feelings diminished as time went on and the engagement became more political then ever before.\n\r\nThe pink-haired princess enters the series when she is traveling in a civilian vessel for a memorial ceremony on Junius Seven. The ship is mistaken for a ZAFT military aircraft, and is attacked by the Earth Alliance. Lacus is escorted to a lifepod, and escapes safely. Shortly thereafter, Lacus' escape pod is discovered by Kira in the Strike. He brings the pod back to the Archangel.\n\r\nThe doors to the life pod open and out hops a small, pink, robotic ball. Following after it is Lacus Clyne herself in a bit of dismay that she was saved by Earth forces. Despite being enemies, the girl is cheery and kind to everyone on the ship as they keep her hostage. ZAFT forces discover the Archangel, and a battle breaks out. Before the Earth Alliance can suffer more loss, Natarle Badgiruel opens a channel to the enemy. It is then revealed to ZAFT that Lacus Clyne, the famous idol, is onboard the Archangel.\n\r\nKira is distraught and, due to Flay's abusive words, comes direly close to an emotional breakdown; however, Lacus attempts to comfort him. The couple find that they both know Athrun Zala on a personal level, and even that Athrun made Lacus' Haro/Pink-chan (her pink, robotic ball) and Kira's Torii (his flying bird robot). Kira decides to return Lacus to where she belongs with Athrun.\n\r\nEven before meeting Kira, Lacus had an indirect influence on the war. She spread her opinion throughout PLANT by singing a song of peace, her lyrics filled with the hope of harmony between the nations. After encountering the Archangel, she expresses a larger need to achieve peace by aiding Kira many more times, causing Athrun to question his purpose for taking part in the war, and much more. In time, she ends up falling in love with Kira (which is seen much more clearly in Gundam Seed Destiny), and Athrun & her engagement is ended without quarrel."

Shinn blames Orb\u2019s rulers, the Athhas, for his family\u2019s deaths, believing that they should have surrendered to the attacking Earth Alliance Forces rather than endangering civilians in a battle that could not be won. Since then, he had a lust for revenge and hated ORB and their \"sugarcoated\" ideals of achieving peace without any weapons, etc.  Orb soldier Captain Todaka then takes care of Shinn and later sends him to the PLANTs, where he joins ZAFT and graduates as one of the top students in his class as a \"ZAFT Red\".\n\r\nAfter graduation, Shinn is assigned to pilot ZAFT's ZGMF-X56S Impulse, and is stationed aboard the battleship Minerva under the command of Talia Gladys along with former military academy classmates Rey Za Burrel, Vino Dupre, Lunamaria Hawke, Meyrin Hawke, and Yolant Kent. Even though the bitter end of his family happened in the past, he has never forgotten it and constantly has reoccuring flashbacks of that time including the good memories he has of his sister."

            "description": "Lunamaria Hawke is a mobile suit pilot on the Minerva, along with Shinn Asuka and Rey Za Burrel. Lunamaria typically pilots a red ZGMF-1000 ZAKU Warrior. Lunamaria appears to wear a customised version of the ZAFT red ace uniform, replacing the standard female-issue skirt with a miniskirt. She attended ZAFT military academy together with her sister Meyrin Hawke, Shinn Asuka, Rey Za Burrel, Vino Dupre, and Yolant Kent. Later all are stationed on board the Minerva.\n\r\nDuring the Armory One Incident, Lunamaria, along with Shinn and Rey, is drawn into the conflict, but the stolen units escape and are picked up by the mirage colloid\u2013cloaked Earth Alliance battleship Girty Lue, waiting outside the colony. The Minerva pursues the Girty Lue, engaging in several battles.\n\r\nDuring the pursuit, Lunamaria meets former ZAFT member Athrun Zala, who is using the alias \"Alex Dino\" and acting as Cagalli Yula Athha\u2019s bodyguard. Lunamaria's interest in Athrun grows when he re-enlists in ZAFT as a member of FAITH and joins the crew of the Minerva. Her attempts to get closer to Athrun are sometimes thwarted by Lacus Clyne impersonator, Meer Campbell. Ironically, Lunamaria appears not to notice her own sister Meyrin's interest in Athrun, even when the two discuss him.\n\r\nLater, Talia Gladys, captain of the Minerva, orders her to spy on Athrun when he meets with his former comrades Kira Yamato and Cagalli from the Archangel. During this meeting, Lunamaria discovers that the Lacus she knows is an impostor. She gives the data and photographs she collected to Talia, but omits mentioning that the Lacus Clyne working for PLANT is not the true Lacus. There are times when she appears to want to discuss the matter with Shinn, but she would not when Rey is around.\n\r\nThe Minerva participates in several incidents during the Second Bloody Valentine War. During the Battle of Crete, Lunamaria\u2019s ZAKU Warrior is heavily damaged and she is badly wounded. Upon the Minerva's arrival at Gibraltar, Lunamaria has recovered and replaces Shinn as pilot of the ZGMF-X56S Impulse, since he is now piloting the ZGMF-X42S Destiny.\n\r\nLunamaria is shocked when she is informed that Athrun and her sister Meyrin have defected together and that Shinn has destroyed the GOUF Ignited in which the pair had attempted to escape. In grief and denial, Lunamaria places the blame on Logos rather than Shinn, who is clearly upset over killing her sister. Lunamaria and Shinn begin relying on each other for emotional support and develop a romantic relationship.\n\r\nAfter Operation: Fury, Lunamaria discovers that both Athrun and Meyrin are alive and on the rogue battleship, Archangel. At the Battle of Messiah, Lunamaria refrains from attacking the Eternal, when she discovers Meyrin is on that ship.\n\r\nLunamaria then battles Athrun, blaming him for taking her sister Meyrin away. He badly damages Lunamaria's mobile suit, the Impulse, with his ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice. Because Lunamaria is getting beaten, Shinn enters SEED Mode and attacks Athrun with his ZGMF-X42S Destiny. Lunamaria interposes herself between the two, trying to get them to stop fighting. Shinn is too enraged to understand what Lunamaria has done, but Athrun enters SEED Mode, blocks Shinn's attack, and saves Lunamaria. Athrun then cripples Shinn's mobile suit and Shinn crashes on the surface of the moon. Lunamaria lands her damaged Impulse nearby and ends up holding a tearful Shinn in her arms, as they watch the Requiem superweapon explode and then the ZAFT fortress, Messiah, crash into the Moon.\n\r\nIn Gundam SEED Destiny \"Final Plus\", both stranded pilots are later rescued by Athrun Zala in the Infinite Justice. At the end of \"Final Plus\", Lunamaria is present with Shinn (alongside Athrun and Meyrin, Kira and Lacus) as he pays tribute to his deceased family in Orb."

Currently he is traveling together with Fai, Kurogane and Sakura, in order to regain Sakura's lost memories, in form of feathers. But to do so, he had to give up his most precious thing - his relationship with her. Thus, even if she regains all her memories, she won't remember him.\n\r\nOne of Syaoran's eyes is blind and seems to be connected to mysterious events surrounding him and his past.\n\nManga Spoilers\nIt is later revealed he is actually a clone of the original Syaoran. He was created by Fei Wong Reed to collect and scatter Sakura's feathers. Before being captured by Fei Wong Reed the original Syaoran manages to place some of his \"heart\" within one of the clone's eyes. At the end of the manga, Syaoran eventually turns against his creator and aids the original Syaoran in trying to save Sakura; however, Fei Wong kills Syaoran. Syaoran is reborn in another world, along with Clone Sakura, and he becomes his original's father. He and Sakura raise the original Syaoran until they send him to Clow Country to meet with his destined person, afterwards sealing themselves inside the glass tube.

            "description": "Birthday: April 1\r\nAge: 14\n\r\nAt the start of the series in both manga and anime, Sakura is the princess of the Kingdom of Clow who has feelings for Syaoran, her childhood friend.\n\r\nWhen she is about to confess her feelings, a mysterious force causes her own dormant magical powers to manifest in the form of feathered wings. When her feathers are scattered across time and space, Syaoran vows to recover all of them because each feather represents a memory Sakura has had since birth and are connected to her heart; without the feathers, she will die.\n\r\nFei-Wong Reed (the mysterious villain in the series) reflects on the ability of people like the High Priest Yukito, Princess Tomoyo of Nihon, and Y\u016bko to cross dimensions and comments that the power concealed within Sakura and the ruins in Clow Country surpasses them all.\n\r\nIn order to cross dimensions, Sakura must pay Y\u016bko the thing most important to her and she pays Y\u016bko in an indirect way but her price is pretty much the same as Syaoran - her memories of him. When she awakes in the Hanshin Republic the first person she sees is Syaoran, but she does not remember anything about him, asking \"Who are you?\"\n\r\nAt times, such as in \u014cuto, Sakura comes extremely close to remembering Syaoran but it is quickly erased once more from her memory. Syaoran, having known this would happen previously, will never tell her anything about their previous relationship. At most, all Sakura knows about Syaoran is what she has relearned from the adventures together with Mokona, Fai, and Kurogane, although she knows she knew him previously and he was very important to her. It is also clear that she is falling in love with him once more.\n\r\nSakura possesses unnaturally good luck; both Chun Hyang and Y\u016bko call her \"a favored daughter of the gods\". This is what allowed her to travel dimensions safely until Y\u016bko asks for her good luck as a price. According to Yukito and Syaoran, Sakura also has the ability to \"hear\" the voices of those who cannot be heard, such as spirits of nature, and to see ghosts. Such as the time in the Country of Jade, she can see Princess Emeraude while others couldn't. She can also see the future in visions, though this ability is unreliable and nothing she has control over.\n\r\nSakura's personality is passive and weary, exhausted from her loss of memories. However as the series goes on, she becomes more stronger and independent. Syaoran states, even though she's lost most of her memories, she'll never change. She helps the group whenever she can, whether it's washing dishes or saving their lives.\n\nHowever, later in the manga, her personality undergoes a change after the clone Syaoran leaves her. As she voices to  Fai, no matter how identical the two Syaorans may be, the real Syaoran is still not the one she knows. Subsequent chapters show Sakura with a much darker personality, accompanied with gothic clothing.\n\r\nIn the Infinity Arc, the group spent a few months fighting in a tournament, supposedly wanting to use the prize money to restore a world the clone Syaoran destroyed. However, the truth is that she was after the real prize - a robot (who is identical to Freya from Chobits) who can let one person and one person alone travel across dimensions.\n\r\nIt is later revealed that Fai is under a curse that forces him to kill if he ever meets a person that is stronger than him. And in volume one, you can see that Y\u016bko was not hit by the rain, nor did she touch any of the people directly; this was because she was in another dimension to prevent Fai's curse from being activated. But when Sakura receives two feathers in the Infinity Arc, she was made stronger than Fai's halved magic and so he stabbed her, seemingly possessed. Sakura had a vision that after killing her, he would go insane and kill everyone else, eventually committing suicide, but she used the robot to transport her soul to a dream world, thus saving herself and stopping Fai from going insane.\n\r\nLater, it's revealed that she was not the original target of the curse, as the real Syaoran was. This is explained further in her appearance in xxxHolic; she changed the future so that Syaoran would not be killed. As she explains to Watanuki (Xxxholic chapter 140), her coldness to the real Syaoran was because she was trying to follow the dream as close as possible up to that near fatal event. It's later learned that Sakura can still be saved. The two places where her body and her soul went contains two feathers. Her soul went to the world of dreams, where it will be aided by the other Syaoran. So the real Syaoran, Fai, Mokona and Kurogane went to Celes Country to rescue the body of Sakura, as Y\u016bko told them it's the body they should rescue first, then the soul.\n\r\nAt the end of the manga, her soul is eventually killed by the clone Syaoran, but just before her death, she reveals that she is a clone of the real Sakura. Her purpose was to map out other dimensions for Fei Wang, who created her, by finding the feathers. She is reincarnated in the original Sakura's body in the past, with her memories intact by Y\u016bko, along with the clone Syaoran. In this life she is friends with Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, of the Magic Knights. Syaoran and Sakura eventually meet and give birth to a boy, who turns out to be the original Syaoran.  They raise him until it is time for him to begin the events of the series, and then they are sealed in a glass tube in order to await the time where Reed attempts to shatter reality. Sakura and Syaoran, after breaking free from the tube, cleanse the feathers, but both ultimately disappear after Kurogane kills Fei Wong, leaving behind only a feather which Sakura's original absorbs.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, CLAMP Wikia)"

Don't submit it.\n\nYuui's twin brother appearing in his flashbacks and supposedly held in Celes Country.\n\nIn Valeria Country, though the birth of the second prince's son was highly anticipated, the birth of twins (Yuui and Fai) was considered to be a bad omen. Shortly after their birth, the second prince died, and their mother committed suicide out of guilt for giving birth to them. In addition, the country suffered many misfortunes, and the twins, when combined, bore powerful magic that rivaled that of the current king.\n\nThe king decided that making Yuui and Fai unhappy was the only way to break the \"curse\", and since both twins refused to kill each other, they were locked up separately in a place where magic is ineffective and time does not flow: a tower residing in a deep valley; Fai was imprisoned atop the tower, and Yuui was confined at the base of the tower. Both were condemned to stay there \"until the world's destruction.\"\n\nDespite their unhappiness, the number of bodies dumped into the base of the tower began to grow. Yuui tried endlessly to climb up towards Fai, so they could escape, but he did not succeed. Eventually, the King became insane, and he executed every person in the country, Beside's Yuui and Fai. He then jumped into the valley himself and committing suicide in front of a horrified Yuui, reminding him that their birth was the reason for the country's misfortune, and that they would now \"pay for that sin\" by being the only people alive in Valeria.\n\nEventually, Fei Wong Reed appeared from another world, and offered to free one of them. Fai chose to save Yuui, resulting in Fai being thrown from the tower to his death. Fei Wong then convinced Yuui that he was the cause of Fai's death and that Fai might be revived if Yuui agrees on becoming Fei Wong Reed's pawn.\n\nAfter meeting Ashura, Yuui took up the name of his dead brother as his own. The body of real Fai was kept underwater in Celes castle by Yuui. It is also revealed that Yuui is in posession of two of  Sakura's feathers. One feather Yuui kept intill he met Sakura so that she woulden't die as soon as she lost her memories. The other feather Yuui used to create his assisstant, Chii. Chii was meant to be a compainion for Fai seince Yuui new he woulden't alway's be in Valeria, And also so Fai's body would not continue decaying. Chii was also created to look like Yuui and Fai's mother.\n\nAshura placed a flourite with Fai the same time that he gave Yuui the name of flourite and it was later reviled that it held one of Sakura's feathers inside it. \nIn Horitsuba Gakuen, he is the twin brother of Fai (in Horitsuba Gakuen) and is a chef from Italy."

            "description": "Kurogane is serious and extremely perceptive, being able to quickly discern Syaoran's fighting ability (along with Syaoran's blind right eye) as well as Fai D. Flourite's true nature and fighting capabilities. While he seems rather irreverent, he is also very loyal. He is likely the most experienced fighter in the group and wiser than he appears. He becomes Syaoran's sword fighting teacher, presenting the boy with the same philosophy he believes in: a sword is used to cut only when needed and not used to cut anything if it is not necessary. While serious, Kurogane is very easily irked by others, especially by Mokona Modoki and Fai, who keep calling him ridiculously cutesy nicknames such as \"Kuro-puu\", \"Kuro-wan-wan\" or \"Kuro-rin\". However abrasive and ruthless Kurogane may seem, he has a compassionate nature and a desire to protect. An example of this would be how Kurogane continually questions Fai on his actions and character, and lets the wizard know that he should stop hanging onto his past and embrace the future with his new companions. Or, Kurogane's own statement that \"If someone wants to take away the ones I want to protect, I'll kill them too\".\n\r\nHis compassion and protective nature is especially clear when his actions early in the series are compared to his actions later on. He had straight out told Syaoran in their first world, the Hanshin Republic, that the quest has nothing at all to do with him. In the next world they visit (Koryo Country) however, Kurogane offers his services to help raid the castle of an evil lord, and stays behind in battle to let Syaoran go on ahead. Eventually, he risks a loss in strength to avenge his comrades' \"death\" (they were of course still alive) by defeating their killer in battle. It is noted that after he finds out Fai and Syaoran are still alive, he lost his passion for the battle.\n\r\nHe obtained a new sword in Outo called the Souhi (Blue Ice or Pale Ice) and taught Syaoran the skills of sword fighting and sensing attacks from the left. \n\nAt the beginning of the story, Kurogane told Syaoran that he would not help in finding Sakura's feathers, since it was not related to him. However, he ended up aiding Syaoran and the others anyway, teaching Syaoran how to fight and use a sword as well.\n\r\nIn the Tokyo arc, Kurogane was involved in a short fight with Kamui. Later, he wished to Yuuko to save Fai's life, after Fai's eye was ripped out by the clone Syaoran. Through an arrangement by Yuuko, Kurogane and Kamui mixed their blood and forced Fai to drink it. Fai thus became a vampire and survived. Since it was not Fai's wish to live but Kurogane's, Fai can only take blood from Kurogane. Fai painfully refrained from calling Kurogane nicknames from then on, in an effort to distance himself from Kurogane.\n\r\nKurogane noticed that Fai and Sakura were up to something in the Infinity world, but did not say anything. After Sakura left, however, he finally spoke up, refusing to let Fai give up his eyesight to go to Celes. Kurogane told Yuuko they would all pay a fourth of the price to go save Sakura's body from Celes.\n\r\nIn the latter parts of Volume 20, Ashura used his magic to show Syaoran, Kurogane, and Mokona visions of Fai's tragic past. This caused an angry and betrayed Kurogane to unsheathe his sword and attack Ashura and Fai. He and Fai fought a fierce battle that devastated the room around them. In the mayhem, Kurogane destroyed the body of Fai's twin and managed to overpower Fai in that moment of weakness, saying to the overpowered Fai something along the lines of \"I thought I already told you I don't have anything to do with your past\". Kurogane then turned on Ashura, demanding to know why he'd shown them Fai's memories. The king responded by saying that he only wanted Fai to \"grant his wish\" and kill him. Ashura then launched vicious spells against Fai, Kurogane, Syaoran, Mokona, and a defenseless Sakura's body in order to force Fai's hand. In the chaos that followed, one of the massive ice stagamites that he conjured pierced Kurogane through his lower right side.\n\r\nKorogane is then apparently spared the damage due to the protective spell that placed upon him before leaving Japan by Tomoyo. He then stabs King Ashura, and after the King's death the group is seen possibly leaving for the next world.\n\r\nFai's second curse caused him to suck up the world of Ceres; Fai tries to transport Kurogane and the others out of the small sphere that Ceres has become, but he doesn't have enough magic to do so. He only succeeds in transporting Syaoran, Sakura, and Mokona. Then Mokona's earring (a magical tool made by Yuuko) was able to drill a hole into the sphere, but only one person could pass through. When Fai told Kurogane to leave him, Kurogane cut off his left arm and left it and Souhi as a sacrifice and rescued Fai.\n\r\nIn chapter 167, Kurogane wakes up and finds himself back in his country, with Princess Tomoyo by his bed. Tomoyo welcomes Kurogane home and asks him if he has found out the true meaning of strength, to which he replies that he doesn't know. However, he explains to Tomoyo that he doesn't regret giving up his arm to take Fai with him, and tells her that he knows that some things can't be protected only by (physical) strength. This surprises Tomoyo, but she acknowledges that Kurogane has definitely realized the true meaning of strength. She then lets Fai into Kurogane's room. Kurogane seems genuinely pleased to see Fai, while Fai doesn't express much emotion, until suddenly he punches Kurogane. Kurogane doesn't quite react to this, far too startled. Fai then smiles at him, saying \"This is payback, Kuro-sama.\" The smile seems like the real thing, and Fai has gone back to using suffixes on Kurogane's name. Kurogane grins back, promising to beat Fai up for that.\n\r\nIn chapter 169, Kurogane is approached by Fuuma who has come to Nihon Country with an artificial arm from Piffle Country, however Kurogane refuses the arm by saying that he \"will not pay anything to that witch for it.\" Fai replies by saying that he had agreed to pay the price while he slept, and gives up the last of his magic. In the second to last page of 169, Kurogane is seen with the arm attached, but claims that it \"feels weird.\"\r\nIn Horitsuba Gakuen, he is the PE teacher."

She's an apprentice angel (anime) or unofficial angel (manga) who speaks like a small child and tries to make everybody around her happy; consequentially making matters worse. She is very hyper and outgoing around Kotarou (for example, her first line said to him in both versions is \"will you go out with me?!\"). She is happy and optimistic, and has always managed to keep on smiling. She becomes best friends with Shia when Shia moves into her home.\n\nDespite of being a really cheerful angel, she has a dark past (which was revealed in manga): When she was younger, she met with boy called Kotaroh (who also looked like Kotarou, being the former's descendant). Unlike other humans, Koutaroh could see angels and other sort supernatural beings due to being half demon (Shia's son). Upon her sister's demand, Misha has to return to Heaven, unable to meet Koutaroh again. This causes great pain on him,making him decide to commited suicide, wanting to meet Misha there. Misha also didn't know, that Kotaroh was actually hated in the village he lived due to his ability to see spirits, specially since that let him know if someone was about to die. Because Kotaroh killed himself over her, she was imprisoned in thorns, and forced to repent. However, years later Sasha, her bigger sister told her that Kotaroh was going to be given another chance and reincarnated as Koutarou, and along with that she'd be given a task to restore her status as an angel: To make Koutarou happy. She wears black clothes as punishment due to her actions leading to Koutaroh's suicide back then and now even normal humans are able to see her.\n\nAlso, in the manga it is revealed that she has romantic feelings for Kotarou."

Though hard to see through her candy-coated exterior, Shia is actually a demon (and not a very good one at that, due to the fact she is kind-hearted and slightly weak). Shia is very domestic and excels at cooking and cleaning.\n\nIn the manga, Shia is more demon than anime: she even bites Kotarou in the neck, and causes him to almost die 2 times, the reason this being later explained that demons feel a greater attraction to their own family's blood. Demons can't survive in the human world for long, so they're forced to take the life from something else (people or animals) to continue living. To preserve her life, Shia was offered Misha's blood, both of them not knowing an angel's lifeforce is actually poisonous to demons, so Shia's life was being shortened in the long run. Shia didn't also say farewell to everyone, she only said them to Ayanokoji. In the manga, it is later revealed that she is Kotarou's great-grandmother. In the book 7, she uses her last powers and dies to the train station, right as she started considering her new life with her memory restored. Nya comes to pick up her body, and complement her on how good a demon she actually was at the end, causing a great scar in her friend's heart, and wasting both his and Taro's (her husband, Koutarou's great-grandfather) time waiting for her to come back."

            "description": "Age: 17\r\nHeight: 172 cm (5'8\")\r\nBirthday: December 9th\r\nFavorite Food: Teriyaki Burgers\r\nHobbies: The Internet\r\nSpecial Skills: Good with Action Games, Swordsmanship \r\nHates: His P.E. Teacher\r\nWeapon: Delflinger (\u30c7\u30eb\u30d5\u30ea\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc), a sentient sword\n\r\nSaito Hiraga, the main male character, is from Earth (specifically Tokyo, Japan). At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara. A portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked through. At first, Saito had no idea where he was, and was thoroughly disoriented. When he arrives on the other side however he is made to sit and obey like a normal household dog. When the bond of him being her familiar, involves having a kiss with the familiar, he is quite shocked at why they do it. In the anime, he also could not identify nor understand the language the students were speaking, but after Louise attempts to cast a silence spell on him that fails, he could understand and communicate with others as though they were speaking Japanese. It is not clear whether he was actually gifted with full knowledge of their language, or whether the misfired spell was similar in principle to a universal translator. This was not the case in the light novel though, where he does understand their language; like the names of the characters, the language spoken by them is also French.\n\r\nThere are Runes inscribed into Saito's hand as a result of his being bound to Louise. They read geboundolf or Gundolf meaning Gand\u00e1lfr (\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30eb\u30f4, Gand\u0101ruvu?). These runes glow when his Gand\u00e1lfr powers activate. As a Gand\u00e1lfr, Saito has the ability to use any object that was made with the intent of being used as a weapon at an extremely high level of skill. He also becomes significantly stronger, faster and tougher. Even weapons that he had never touched before, such as an M-72 rocket launcher and a World War II Zero Fighter, can be instantly understood and utilized. This physical augmentation fades more or less instantly when he stops using the power, which can result in him falling unconscious if he'd been wounded previously. That he can only use items specifically crafted for the purpose of weapons was revealed by Derflinger after a failed attempt to use an ornamental sword. It has not been made clear whether Gand\u00e1lfr powers could be used in conjunction with purely magical weaponry such as a wand or a staff. Even with these abilities he doesn't defend himself at all against Louise's constant beatings.\n\r\nThe series constantly implies him being a pervert and sometimes he does think exactly like one, but justifiably, he is a young single guy who isn't married to anyone. Louise just enforces an ownership type arrangement over Saito implying she is owed Saito's feelings. It is later revealed that Saito has feelings for Louise and even says it openly to her.\n\r\nSaito also has a bit of a troublesome and somewhat complicated tendency of getting involved with women. Strange and oddly sexual things happen when he seemingly becomes intimate with another girl. A few examples are when Kirche or even Siesta try to gain his attention, by mostly sexual seduction. When he meets or speaks to an attractive girl, he is often only noticing her chest in a few instances . This is actually one of the main reasons why Louise treats him so poorly as he is expected to be perfect in every way in her childish mindset.\n\r\nAlthough he acts a bit perverted at times, this does not mean that he does not think of Louise. Similar to how she feels whenever he is becoming intimate with another girl (specifically with large breasts) Saito can get very upset when it comes to Louise and other men. He dislikes Julio for his \"snobbish\" interest in Louise, especially since he is adored by all the other young girls in Tristain Academy. He becomes extremely jealous and calls him a bastard whenever he tries to touch Louise or gain her attention. He also becomes upset he hears of Louise being married off to someone else. When his friends dragged him into a hole to peep at the girls while they were bathing, he was extremely protective of Louise and stopped them before they saw her naked.He uses the name \"My Louise\" several times in the light novels when he feels jealous toward other guys. This is definite evidence of his strong feelings for Louise.\n\r\nHis partner, the talking sword Derflinger, was also the partner of the Gand\u00e1lfr from six-thousand years ago. His advice and comments never reflect well on Saito. Saito protects Louise because he is her familiar, and it is later shown that he has feelings for her as well, claiming \"All that he is good at is protecting her.\" He is revealed to be a Gand\u00e1lfr, a familiar who exists to protect a Void Wizard as they cast their spells. Even when this fact becomes known to Louise, she still physically assaults him, while Saito is seen often shrugging it off as his fault. Saito was given the nickname \"Our Sword\" by the head cook in episode three, where Louise takes Saito into town to purchase a weapon for him, which happens to be the legendary sword Derflinger. By the beginning of the third series, the magical runes on Saito's hand mysteriously disappear, and Saito's position of Gand\u00e1lfr is in question. He regains them when he is re-summoned by Louise. With the return of runes, Saito is knighted for the feat of stopping an entire army by himself, and given a hero's welcome at the Academy. Saito is named after Gennai Hiraga who is an Edo period Japanese scientist, and his name is written as \"ability man.\"\n\nIn Zero no Tsukaima F, the final episode, he gets married to Louise. He also traveled back to Japan, accompanied by Louise because of her teleport magic."

            "description": "Age: 15; 16; 17\r\nBirthday: Unknown, December 25 (date of adoption)\r\nHeight: 168 cm (5'6\"), now 174 cm (5'8 1/2\") \r\nWeight: 127.9 lbs (58 kg), now 123 lbs (56 kg)\r\nBlood type: O\r\nNationality: British \r\nFavorite food: Mitarashi Dango\n\r\nBack Story\n\r\nAllen is the main hero of the series. He was abandoned by his biological parents because of the supposed \"deformity\" of his left arm (which was later revealed to be caused by his Innocence). He was eventually found and adopted by a traveling performer named Mana Walker on Christmas Day. Some time later Mana died, and Allen, tormented with grief and manipulated by the Millennium Earl, turned Mana into an Akuma, hoping that his beloved surrogate father would be fully resurrected. But the Mana Akuma cursed Allen and sliced through his left eye, leaving the \"Pentacle\" \u2014 the mark of the Akuma \u2014 which scars the left side of his face. This enabled his left eye to see the souls trapped within the Akuma from then on. It was at this same moment that Allen's left arm first invoked as an Anti-Akuma weapon, which instinctively destroyed the Mana Akuma. During the course of this traumatic event, Allen's hair turned from brown into a stark white.\n\r\nAllen eventually meets Cross Marian, a General of the Black Order, who explained to Allen the ways of the Akuma and the trapped souls within them: Once a soul becomes trapped inside an Akuma, they are trapped forever; and that the only way to save one is to exorcise them from their Akuma vessel. Allen subsequently became Cross' disciple and spent the next three years with him before being sent to the Black Order to become an official exorcist. During this time, Allen was tormented by his master's constant irresponsible behavior and forced into various odd-jobs to pay off the debts that General Cross accumulated. This, coupled with Marian's womanizing ways and harsh treatment towards Allen, led to Walker fearing more than respecting his master whom he never speaks fondly of. In fact, when Jasdevi claims that Cross is like a demon, Allen denies this and instead insists that Cross is a real demon. In addition, when Jasdevi reveal that the debts Cross left to them total about 2 million yen, Allen grows demon horns, laughs at them, and calls their debts small change in comparison to his own, leaving Lavi to wonder just how much money Allen's been made to pay.\n\r\nAbilities\n\r\nIn addition to being physically fit and skilled at combat (as evident by his ability to fight and dodge Fou without the use of his Innocence), Allen has a few odd talents and skills. Because of the many debts Allen was forced into paying by Cross, he learned to play cards and gamble at a very young age, though his initial purpose was to practice his numb deformed left hand. He also learned how to cheat and win through deception and doesn't hesitate to use these tactics whenever necessary. In fact, he is quite proud of his talents. This is a stark contrast to his polite and courteous nature and often surprises his friends who wouldn't expect such a dark side to Allen and has caused them to wonder just what Cross has done to him. Walker also possesses circus abilities such as juggling and acrobatics, which he learned from traveling with Mana who was himself a circus clown by trade.\n\r\nAllen's synchronization ratio reached a maximum of 83% before having his Innocence destroyed by Tyki. Yet unknown to Allen, the Innocence lingered around as a hazy fog of particles; at the time, a direct reflection of his shattered state of mind. It wasn't until he came to an epiphany that he was able to seize control of his Anti-Akuma weapon once again and achieving his Innocence's true, fully-invoked form. When not activated, his arm is black and meets with his shoulder in a spiraling pattern that ends with tattoo-like emblem. Following this, the Order gave it the official designation of Crowned Clown (\u795e\u30ce\u9053\u5316\uff08\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\uff09, Kuraun Kuraun), due to its jester-like appearance when invoked. The kanji used in the name literally translates to God's Clown (\u795e\u30ce\u9053\u5316, Kami no Douke).\n\r\nWhen invoked, Crowned Clown acts as a body-armored Innocence, forming a white-hooded cowl and sleeve of Innocence energy which covers his shoulders and right arm, while his left arm and hand become slender and black, clad in armor and razor sharp claws. A masquerade-style mask is always affixed to the cowl, which takes on various configurations and appearances. This transformation also changes Allen's usual hairstyle from flat to a spiky rear. As before, his Innocence possesses a certain degree of sentience, but as Crowned Crown is able to manipulate Allen's entire body like a marionette when incapacitated, or simply assisting in evasive tactics.\n\r\nWhen facing Tyki yet again, Allen synchronization with his Innocence exceeded 100% which activated his new Crowned Crown ability, Sword of Exorcism. The Sword of Exorcism has the ability to exorcist an Akuma on touch and even the ability to exorcist the Noah Gene from Noah's themselves. What shocked Tyki the most wasn't the ability of the sword but rather the similarity between Allen's Sword of Exorcism and the Millennium Earl's sword.\n\r\nStory\n\r\nInspector Levrier and Cross have both referred to a \"player\" (as in one who plays a musical instrument), and Cross has hinted that there may be more than one.\n\nAllen Walker has the 14th a.k.a Nea inside of him. Cross and Nea made a deal with each other and it was Cross who agree to have Allen hold Nea's consciousness. After being struck by Kanda's Innocence, the Nea inside Allen begin to awaken and slowly take over Allen's body."

            "description": "Birthdate: June 6\r\nAge: 17, currently 18\r\nHeight: 177cm (5'9\"); was 175 cm (5'8\") (start)\r\nWeight: 59 kg (130 lbs); was 61kg (134 lbs) (start)\r\nHair Color: Dark Blue, Black \r\nEye Color: Dark Blue\r\nBlood Type: AB\r\nInterest: Gardening, making Soba \r\nLikes: Soba, Tempura (pumpkin, green peppers, and lotus root) \r\nDislikes: Anything group related and lots more\r\nNationality: Japanese\r\nRelatives: Unknown \n\r\nKanda Yuu is a main protagonist character and member of the fictional religious organization known as the Black Order, in the anime and manga series D.Gray-man, by Katsura Hoshino.\n\r\nKanda is a young and handsome Japanese man usually found in any mood that isn't positive. Kanda has long black hair (dark blue in the anime), which the mangaka notes that he uses soap to wash. Lavi comments that Kanda is a \"pretty-type character\", and Allen occasionally calls him \"feminine face\". He also has been commented that he has \"dark eyes\" by the head of the Asian branch (9 years ago) and he has blue eyes in the manga. Kanda seems to be conceited over his hair.\n\r\nPersonality\n\r\nKanda comes across as cold, stoic, and arrogant, even to his fellow exorcists. In battle he will do anything to win, sometimes at the risk of his teammates. He once made a sarcastic joke about leaving them to die. It is his opinion that exorcists are not saviors.\n\r\nYuu, or Yuu, is Kanda's given name, though he dislikes being called by it or even introducing himself as such. He calls Allen \"bean sprout\" (\u30e2\u30e4\u30b7, moyashi, English Dub: \"Short Stack\"). Kanda seems to know Lavi, though he doesn't hesitate with his usual threats if Lavi calls Kanda by his given name; however, it is clear that Kanda does care for his fellow Exorcists and the Finders (whom he claims not to care about).\n\r\nHe tends to mask his emotions and often claims, \"It's none of my business.\" In spite of his intentions, he and Allen are often at each other's throats and rarely see eye-to-eye on anything.\n\nKanda's personality seems not to have changed since he was young. At age 9, he was moody and easily annoyed, especially towards another \"second exorcist,\" Alma Karma, who often followed him around; however, his final conflict with Alma seems to have hardened him further, for, though he was seen laughing with Alma as a child, no such display of frivolity has been witnessed since then.\r\nKanda's favorite foods are soba noodles and tempura (especially pumpkin, shishitou [a small, sweet green pepper], and lotus root). Kanda dislikes many things, to the point that \"there are too many to write down\"; however, Kanda himself points out that he hates people with naive personalities, people who don't keep their promises, cursed people, people who can't keep their mouths shut, people who call him by his given name, and \"sweet things\".\n\n\r\nHistory\n\nKanda was originally an Innocence accomodator and exorcist of the Black Order, but he was killed by an Akuma. There was also a woman in his life whom he loved.\n\r\nKanda is \"reborn\" a second generation exorcist created by the order 9 years previous to the current events of the story through the efforts of the Epstain and Chang families. His body was modified to heal incredibly quickly in order to sustain synchronization tests. He regularly underwent a shockingly cruel and painful procedure to force them to be able to synchronize with his Innocence, literally tearing him apart in the process. Due to his second exorcist strength and ability to regenerate, the procedure was repeated even after he had \"died\" several times. Although initially extremely hostile towards Alma Karma, another child of the second exorcist program, the two eventually become close friends due to their shared experience at the hands of the Order.\n\r\nYu begins seeing an illusion of a woman who Alma initially assumes is Fou, the guardian deity of the Asia branch since she had appeared to Alma whilst he was distressed following syncro-testing. He also starts to dream of her and of his death at the hands of an Akuma. The Order realize this and decide that they should terminate Yuu from the program. Alma hears this conversation and rescues Yuu although he is captured by CROW guards in the process.\n\r\nAfter landing in a sewer he is washed up in front of a younger Bak Chan and Noise Marie. Eventually after a brief exchange Kanda was taken by the members of CROW to be \"terminated\" for learning the truth about the Second Exorcist program. The \"procedure\" proves a failure as Kanda's past memories of an unknown woman reanimate him and allow him to summon the Innocence of Mugen in a sword form which he uses to free himself. As he is escaping he finds an injured Marie and while examining his wound, his blood starts to heal Marie. Kanda decides to take Marie with him in his search of Alma but upon finding him discovers that Alma has killed the staff of the Asian Branch and the members of CROW with his own newly-acquired Innocence. A battle ensues between a psychotic Alma and Kanda resulting in Yuu's arm being cut off. As Alma explains his reasons for murdering everyone he attacks Marie and impales Kanda, leading him to find the resolve to deal a menacing blow to Alma.\n\r\nAbilities\n\r\nKanda can recover much faster than ordinary humans and able to withstand the blood of Akuma due to a secret skill created by the Chang family, he is also seen being able to rebirth after death \"approximately during 580 seconds\", reproduce falling limbs, and have an abnormal physical strength.\r\nInnocence\n\r\n\"Mugen\" (\u516d\u5e7b,Six Illusions). Kanda has a sword with supernatural powers. He runs his index and middle finger through the back of the blade to activate it, whilst saying Mugen Unsheathe, Innocence Activate, which turns the blade silver. The Shape of the sword has changed throughout Kanda's Timeline, during his childhood, it takes the form of a small butcher blade with multiple small wings on the hilt, upon Kanda's introduction in the beginning of the series, it took the form of a chokuto (a straight Japanese sword without a tsuba) with a black cross-emblazoned hilt and sheath, but after his battle with Skin Boric, it was reforged into a traditional Katana.\n\nKaich\u016b: Ichigen (\u754c\u87f2\u300c\u4e00\u5e7b\u300d English dub: Underworld Creatures, First Illusion, lit. Hell's Insects: First Illusion): Kanda swings his sword and releases a small swarm of supernatural creatures that devour his opponents.\r\nNigentou (\u4e8c\u5e7b\u5200, lit. Double Illusion Blades): Kanda covers his sword and scabbard in a coat of energy and generates an energy blade, creating two impossibly sharp weapons. The second blade that he creates over his scabbard can also be just a pure energy blade if the scabbard is not used. \n\r\nHakka Tourou (\u516b\u82b1\u87f7\u8782, lit. Eight Flowers Praying Mantis): Using Nigentou, Kanda quickly slashes the enemy eight times. The slashes collectively resemble a flower.\n\r\nShouka (\u6607\u83ef, lit. Sublimate): Kanda activates the power of his tattoo, and his pupil changes into three dots. Veins also rise around his eyes. Once Shouka is activated, Kanda can activate Sangenshiki. \n\r\nSangenshiki (\u7981\u5fcc \u300c\u4e09\u5e7b\u5f0f\u300d, lit. Three Illusions): Kanda drastically increases his speed and strength at the cost of some of his life. \n\r\nConsume, Mugen: Kanda reconstructs a broken Mugen by reconnecting the pieces with energy. Mugen appears to fall apart after one slash, however. \n\r\nBakuhakuzan (\u7206\u9b44\u65ac, lit. Explosive Spirit Slash): Kanda needs Sangenshiki to be active to use this, and makes a slash that seems to create small explosions and is strong enough to cut through a Level 4 Akuma. Kanda can also use it with the Fifth Illusion Style.\n\r\nFourth Illusion Style: Kanda's Pupil changes to four dots and he gains another drastic increase in speed and power.\n\r\nFifth Illusion Style: Kanda's hair changes to a shade of light purple and stands up straight, while Mugen's blade glows with a different color and emanates large amounts of electricity. It uses a large amount of Kanda's life. The effects of this sword also seems to give Kanda a need for destruction while sealing up the rest of his emotions leaving only his anger. When he uses the maximum power of the fifth illusion style, the sword takes the same form as when he was child (small butcher blade with multiple small wings on the hilt).\n\r\nRipping Flash Claw: Kanda unleashes seven sharp energy beams.\r\n(Source: D.Gray-Man Wikia)"

Her parents were killed by an Akuma when she was very young. Because she is an Accommodator, the Black Order took her away from her only remaining family member (Komui) to Headquarters against her will. For three years she was never allowed to leave the place, which felt like a prison to her. Because she attempted suicide, she had to be restrained and tied to her bed. However, once Komui joined the Black Order, Lenalee became more at ease in the Black Order. She once told Allen that her \"world\" consists of her friends and family; if something terrible ever happened to them, she would be devastated.\n\r\nShe is an Exorcist whose anti-Akuma weapon is a pair of boots, \"Dark Boots.\" That, when invoked increases one's speed and strength greatly in the legs.\n\r\nAside from being able to have great speed, she can also fly with her boots. Techiniques shown so far:\r\n- Onkyou no tougi: Otokase\r\n- Suijou no tougi: Mizukase\r\n- Enbu Kirikaze\r\n- Shittsui no tougi: Tetsukase\n\r\nAfter the battle against the Level 3 Akuma, Lenalee lost the ability to use her Dark Boots for period of time. However, it has come to mind that after the battle, her innocence may be the heart of the innocence.\n\nManga spoilers:\nIn chapter 153 she made a promise with her innocence so it would become stronger to protect everything she loves, and so it liquified and fused with her blood, creating a better version of her Dark Boots. After defeating the Level 4 Akuma, the boots transformed into a red ring that stays on her legs until the innocence is activated.\n\r\nShe is the first known exorcist to create this new type of innocence named \"Crystal Type.\"\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

His parents were killed by Akuma when they were young, and when it was found out that Lenalee was compatible with an Innocence she was taken away from him. It was shown that Lenalee was kept in the Black Order, away from her only living family (Komui), against her will. When she tried to commit suicide, she had to be strapped down to the bed. However, Komui joined the Order and became the Science Department Supervisor for her sake and Lenalee begin to feel more at home in the Order.\n\r\nKomui is shown as a very whimsical and goofy character, he is somewhat sadistic and borderline maniacal sometimes (\"Why did Komui end up so strange...? I patterned this character after Yoshida. My editor.\" - Quote from Vol 1, Komui's profile page). He drinks coffee nonstop (or more specifically Lenalee's coffee unless he has no choice), is lazy and often tries to worm his way out of doing work by either running away from the office (Reever has to track him down), talking on the phone non-stop even when the other side hung up or other methods (he created a robot named Komurin II that went berserk and nearly tore the Headquarter apart). He keeps a notoriously messy desk and lost Allen's letter of recommendation from General Cross when Allen first joined the Order, which led the Order into believing that Allen was an intruder. In the manga when it was asked how much do his colleagues trust Komui, the mangaka answered that it was 99% trust and 1% murderous intent. During his naps, one of the only ways to wake him up is to say that Lenalee is getting married due to his doting personality.\n\r\nKomui, despite everything, does have a serious side. He feels guilty for throwing the Exorcists and Finders into danger, and tries to help in anyway he can, such as making better uniforms to protect the Exorcists. He is also the one to repair damages done to the Innocences of the Exorcists although the method seems very painful. He showed a more solemn and ruthless side in the funeral for the Exorcists and Finders by refusing requests to bring General Yeager's body back to his home and saying that the General's body must be cremated. Firm in his beliefs, Komui has shown a daring in refusing to follow Special Auditor Malcom Rouvelier's orders about keeping the Akuma Egg, and instead issues his own orders for the Egg's destruction.\n\r\nLenalee and Komui seem to share some kind of telepathic link, shown when Komui collapsed when Lenalee was being drowned by Eshi and that Lenalee can tell when Komui is taking a nap even from the other side of the world. He seems to be close friends with the cook Jerry and often hides out in the kitchen."

Daisuke is kind-hearted, the opposite of Dark and always trying to stop Dark from performing crazy stunts to no avail. Later in the series, Daisuke gradually falls in love with his old crush's older twin sister, Riku Harada. Even though he does not look or act it, Daisuke is very perceptive and athletic\u2014capable of jumping from heights that a normal boy could never be capable of. To hone his skills, his family sets up daily life-threatening trials once he returns home from school. A specialty of this is his gift for lockpicking (or hacking, in the case of electronically activated locks) any kind of lock in succession.\n\r\nDaisuke, as a Niwa, has been trained in thievery all his life. He can dodge traps, pick locks, sneak past security, and break into almost any location; however, he prefers to create art, not steal it."

He was dormant for 40 years due to the fact that Daisuke's grandfather (who was Dark's host before Daisuke) had no male offspring. It is not possible for females to be the Phantom Thief.\n\r\nHe is the phantom thief who constantly steals art pieces made by the Hikari family. Unlike Daisuke, who likes Risa, Dark fell in love with Riku. However, he is constantly being pursued by Risa, who fell for him when she first saw him on the news. It is shown in the manga that he was slowly falling for Risa (volume 10 of the manga)before says that he can \"feel\" her words \"right here\" in his heart (volume 9). He uses Wiz (With) as his wings, because using his actual black wings would harm Daisuke severely.\n\r\nIn the anime, Dark informs Risa that he has no feelings for her except as she reminds him of her grandmother, whom he truly loved.\n\r\nIn the English version, Dark is known as the Phantom Thief Dark, while in Japanese, he is Kaitou Dark. Dark's full name is Dark Mousy, though this name is only used in the character descriptions of the manga. In the anime, he is once called by this name by Krad. His real name, however, is Kokuyoku, and he is one half of the exalted Black Wings, with Krad being the other half. It is apparent that they once belonged to the same artwork and were enjoined, but were at some point awakened and separated."

Negi Springfield is the son of master mage Nagi Springfield, famously known as the legendary \"Thousand Master\" and princess Akira of the Ostian Empire in the magic world. At present, Negi has formed 11 temporarily pactio with his students (Asuna, Nodoka, Setuna, Konoka, Yue, Haruna, Chisame, Kazumi, Kaede, Kuu Fei, and Chachamaru) and 1 temporarily pactio with Theo, which gives him the artifact that allow him to use any of his partner's artifact.\n\r\nNegi specialize in Wind spells and Lightning spells (his father's specialty) though he is initially lacking in battle experience. He later trains under Ku Fei in Martial Arts to make up for his weakness in close combat, advancing very quickly (even learning how to do instant movement, otherwise known as shundou), and applies a strong magical barrier around himself to avoid damaging his frail body. He eventually becomes a master of using delayed spells as a battle tactic. Due to the training he had with Evangeline and Jack Rakan, his magic and combat capability increases exponentially. Negi also learns and improves upon Evangeline's \"Magia Erebea,\" which absorb offensive spells into his own body. He also came up with a new spell: \"Spell Synthesis: Lightning God Lance Titan Slayer\" which is a new high class lightning spell. Negi even manage to use Magia Erebea's ultimate ability by using a magic circle that can stop and absorb the enemy's attack whether it is magical or spiritual attack and use it against them, which even Evangeline herself could not master it. In the latest chapter, it is shown that Magia Erebea marks have begin to spread all over Negi's body and that Negi has formed a temporarily pactio with Shiori, one of Fate's subordinates.\n\r\nHis aim is to become a Magister Magi (master mage) like his father and find his father who is currently missing."

            "description": "Age: 28\r\nBirthday: June 20, 1849\r\nHeight: 158 cm\r\nWeight: 48 kg\n\r\nKenshin Himura, also known throughout the anime as Hitokiri Battousai (Battousai the Manslayer) or Himura the Battousai is the main character of the anime series Rurouni Kenshin.  His original name was Shinta (\u5fc3\u592a).  His parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon.  Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and were about to kill him when a man named Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning \"Heart of Sword,\" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.\n\nHowever, before full completion of the sword style could be passed on to Kenshin, the Japanese Revolution had been happening at the time and right before Kenshin's eyes.  Because of his kind nature and seeing people suffering, he knew he needed to do something about it.  He left in the middle of his training and without his master's blessing and joined the Imperialists.  It was during the Revolution where Kenshin met Tomoe, his first love and wife.  (See Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal OVAs).  During the revolution, Kenshin was given the nickname of Hitokiri Battousai because of his god-like speed of drawing a sword to kill the enemy instantly.  \n\r\nAfter helping the Imperialist to a position where they would undoubtedly win the revolution, Kenshin left the revolution all-together with a vow to never kill again and the reverse-blade sword handed to him by Shakku-dono. It was Tomoe's death by his hands that pushed him over the edge of never to kill again.\n\r\nThe next time Kenshin is seen is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes.  Those long 10 years have taken him from Kyoto, all over Japan to where we find him in episode one of the anime, in Tokyo, still keeping his vow never to kill again.  It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again. (See Rurouni Kenshin anime).  \n\r\nKenshin is usually depicted as a care-free swordsman who is very aloof and tends to be a bit simple-minded when it comes to living normally.  He is seen to be doing many of the chores around the dojo that he stays at with Kaoru, (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.).  He believes it is his way of repaying Kaoru with allowing him to stay at her dojo. (although it seems he has gotten attracted to kaoru in the end).\n\r\nHowever, his swordsmanship ranks among the elite as he is seen defeating every rival (with the exception of Hajime Saitou which ended in a draw).  His battle senses are top-notch and he recognizes even the slightest of advantages, strategies and tactics during a sword battle.  \n\r\n(Source: Kenshin Wikia)"

He would return home years later to discover that his mother was dead, having died a couple of years after the birth of his younger brother, Ota, who immediately began to admire Sanosuke for his bravery and boldness. Sanosuke would also find out that his family name was now Higashidani, although he would never use it himself. His sister, after Sanosuke's disappearance and then her mother's death, became overprotective of her younger brother and father, who worked as a local merchant and farmer with the infamy of being a local fighter. Ota, after Sanosuke leaves his family again, would eventually follow his brother's advice and train at the Kamiya Kasshin-Ry\u016b style dojo to become strong.\n\r\nThe Sekihoutai fought for the imperial alliance at the end of the Tokugawa regime and Sanosuke admired his captain, Sagara S\u014dz\u014d and took the family name Sagara from him. The Sekih\u014d Army were on assignment to spread word of the halving of taxes proclaimed by the revolution. However, when the revolutionary government encountered financial problems, they labeled the Sekihoutai as frauds to bury their promises. This setup was engineered by Shind\u014d Tatewaki, a former officer in the imperial alliance. The Sekihoutai were designated scapegoats and to be executed; Sanosuke was the only survivor, other than his friend Tsukioka Katsuhiro. The exact circumstances of S\u014dz\u014d's death differ between the animated version and the manga; in the manga Sanosuke realized he had been killed after seeing his decapitated head on display as a warning, while in the anime a wounded S\u014dz\u014d pushed Sanosuke to safety off a cliff in order to save him before dying himself.\n\r\nFull of anger and bitterness, Sanosuke made a living as a fighter-for-hire who bore the nickname \"Zanza\" derived from his weapon, the zanbat\u014d. Sanosuke's sword, the heaviest katana ever made in the Rurouni Kenshin universe, originates from the \u014cnin Struggle. Due to wear the blade no longer has an edge. Sanosuke uses the sword to smash and crush.\n\r\nHiruma Kihei and Gohei hire Sanosuke to kill Himura Kenshin, but after the former assassin defeats Sanosuke and Sanosuke learns of the truth of Kenshin's no-kill approach, Sanosuke becomes a valuable ally. He later adopts a boxing-like fighting skill, known for the strength of his right fist. Because the zanbat\u014d broke during the fight, Sanosuke no longer wields it on a regular basis, using only one more time in the manga to defend the Kamiya dojo during the Jinchu arc.\n\r\nAt the end of the manga series, Sanosuke leaves Japan to avoid becoming wrongfully arrested and travels the world. He is not heard from until five years later during a reunion of the Kenshin-gumi, in which he tells them via a letter that he is in Mongolia and will stay there for a while before heading back to Japan.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

However, all the battles he fought were for the losing side, and Kambei lives in the shadow of his painful and stigmatic past. He uses a stylized katana, though on several occasions, he uses two swords at once. He is selected by Kirara to lead the villagers against the bandits when her water crystal reacts to his passing in the city. At first Kambei disregards Katsushiro and Kikuchiyo as too inexperienced and immature to defend the village, but eventually recognizes both as full samurai and makes them the fifth and seventh, respectively."

He wishes to become Kambei's student, and promises to protect Kirara no matter what. He first meets the villagers when a thief attempts to steal their rice in the city, but Kirara initially has doubts about his skill because he does not have the \"scent of battle\" on him. However, Katsushiro gains steadily in skill throughout the series: at the outset he cannot defeat a simple thug and is beaten by a single blow, but by the end he can defeat numerous Nobuseri at once, deflect an enemy beam cannon shot with his sword and lead the villagers in their successful defense against the capital.\n\r\nOf the samurai, Katsushiro's character evolves the most throughout the series. At first he is overcome with shock upon his first kill. Kirara is overcome with guilt for having brought him into a situation in which he is forced to take life, and pledges to support him even as he falls into darkness. Kambei and the other samurai soon teach Katsushiro that taking life is part of being a true samurai. By the last battle he can kill numerous enemies without flinching. Katsushiro takes a liking to Kirara early on in the series, attempting to protect her in numerous situations, and at one point asks her to come with him after he has a falling out with Kambei. He later returns to Kanna village after his solo journey as a much more mature and skilled samurai.\n\nKatsushiro is one of the 3 surviving samurai following the final battle against the capital, and is shown post-battle to have gained significant wisdom and maturity from his experiences. His skills are improved enough by the end that Kambei even shows great respect towards him, and presents Katsushiro with his own katana. In the end he leaves the village to continue his samurai life.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Because of his skill in battle and acrobatic ability (among them the ability to pull arrows out of the air and dodge other attacks) Kambei makes him his \"left hand man\" in defending the village. Gorobei is one of the more lighthearted characters found in the anime, often making light of rather serious or dangerous situations. He admits at one point to believe that dying is losing and living is winning. Gorobei seems to have a bloodletting fetish of some sort, based on his reaction in two of the episodes. \n\nDuring the final skirmish, the bandit leader fired his gun at a weakened Kambei, but Gorobei intercepts the bullet with his sword. Unfortunately, the bullet detonates an instant later, mortally wounding him. Kambei blames himself for what just happened, saying he has \"stolen his life\", after which Gorobei dies a moment later. Later on, just before the final battle with Ukyo, a vision of Gorobei appears to Katsushiro, who gives him advice to shake him out of his depression. \n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He is often looked upon as a clown or a bother; he gets angry easily and often causes trouble. He carries the biggest of the swords, which also acts as a chainsaw when need be. At first rejected by the other six, Kambei accepts Kikuchiyo into the fold when the latter reveals his reasoning for helping the villagers - that he, too, came from a family of farmers. He is a largely sympathetic character, having literally given up his flesh to become a samurai and change his fate as a poor farmer. He is well liked by the villagers, especially by little Komachi, who asks him to become her husband when she grows up, a request that he accepts in return for her keeping his (fake) family tree. (wikipedia)\n\nDuring the final battle with Ukyo, Kikuchiyo is severely damaged by Ukyo and gets ferried away from the battlefield by Rikichi, Kirara, and Komachi. But when Ukyo's fortress is set on a collision course with Kanna village, Kikuchiyo places himself between the two. Using all his strength, he single-handedly (literally) stops the enormous fortress from hitting Kanna. But the strength he used to stop the fortress was so intense that he melted down to almost nothing, leaving only his feet where he had planted himself into the ground."

He is most helpful within the group as their mechanic, and orchestrates the construction of medieval-type weapons to fight the giant mechanized Nobuseri. He loves rice more than any other person in the series and can tell where it&#039;s from just by the taste. He hates traitors, and is uncompromising in that respect due to the fact that he once betrayed his comrades by revealing information that resulted in his entire platoon being killed. He grows to become a more forgiving and understanding man due to Kambei&#039;s influence. The sword he carries has a rain charm hanging from the end.\n\nDuring the final battle with Ukyo, Heihachi comes up with a plan to stop Ukyo&#039;s fortress by separating the engine from the rest of the ship by blowing up the connections. Just as he&#039;s finishing setting up his plan, he gets pinned to the ship by a large chunk of metal and is forced to detonate the explosives while he&#039;s still on the engine, where he falls to his death. Upon searching the rubble from the crashed engine, Rirara and Komachi discover Heihachi&#039;s weather charm."

He likes to irritate Hijikata and the rest of the Shinsengumi by acting like a girl. He loves children and has a sweet tooth, and he adores Kyoto candies. One of the youngest members of the Shinsengumi, he mastered all the sword techniques of the Tennen-rishin-ryuu (the style of kenjutsu used by the Shinsengumi) in his teens and went on to become a teacher in his twenties. He is considered to be one of the best swordsmen of pre-Meiji Japan.\n\r\nOkita's childhood name is Soujirou, and you'll often hear children in the series calling him by that name. The reason he gives for allowing them to call him by such a nostalgic name is that if he uses the name 'Okita Souji,' no one will play with him...Yes, he is in his early twenties, but he still plays with children all the same. He is short for a guy and seems to like walking along with his hair flowing freely behind him when he is off-duty.\n\r\nHijikata, Okita's mentor, made Okita choose whether or not he would take up the katana at the age of nine. In episode 7, Okita accuses Hijikata of having made a mistake with him, by allowing him to hold a katana at an age where he was not yet ready to choose.\n\r\nAlthough he is an excellent swordsman, he has two weak points. He can't adjust his strength to accommodate the people around him, and as a result, no one wants to practice with him (since they always end up with injuries). Even with an armour and shinai (bamboo sword), Okita can cause serious injuries. He also has a disease called Tuberculosis which surfaces from time to time."

Vash usually exaggerates foolish characteristics to make people feel unthreatened and to hide his identity; for instance, exhibiting an almost obsessive love of doughnuts and at one point introduced himself as \"Valentinez Alkalinella Xifax Sicidabohertz Gombigobilla Blue Stradivari Talentrent Pierre Andri Charton-Haymoss Ivanovich Baldeus George Doitzel Kaiser III.\" Vash's reputation as \"The Humanoid Typhoon\" is legendary, as is the damage and destruction associated with his presence. However, when those around him are threatened, Vash shows complete focus and control.\n\r\nVash is a very multidimensional character\u2014quite literally a walking contradiction. He is often a womanizer, and other times a gentleman. Sometimes he is a coward, yet other times he shows great courage. He is a wanted man, yet he wouldn't hurt a fly. \n\nDespite his age, he still hasn't found peace with himself. A point of conflict in the series are the inner differences between Vash and Millions Knives, his twin brother, and their regard for humanity. Though Vash and Knives have gone through the same experience and torment, Vash chooses to remain hopeful and loving toward humanity, where as Knives has fallen into a deep-seated hatred of their race. Their personalities also have key differences: Vash cannot stand the despair of being alone, whereas Knives revels in his loneliness and has no desire for any company.\n\r\nBecause Vash refuses to kill any of his opponents, he often suffers at the hands of very persistent enemies and their attempts at revenge. As a result, his body is a patchwork of large scars, chunks of missing flesh supported by metal mesh, and stitch marks."

He is stern, unforgiving and cruel on the surface, but once you scratch his surface, you'll find that there's much, much more to this serious-looking man than meets the eye.\n\r\nHe is the founding member of the Shinsengumi that wrote the Internal Regulations and developed the fighting style that Shinsengumi came to be known for, the Tennen-Rishin Ryu. In the series, he seems to be the one in control of the entire Shinsengumi, though the decisions of the Shinsengumi are made by a council of three: Kondou, Hijikata, and Yamanami. The mentor of Okita Souji, the tensai swordsman, he was no pushover in swordfighting. In episode one, you'll get a taste of just how good Hijikata is.\n\r\nIn the later episodes, Hijikata is seen to worry about Okita's illness as well as about Tetsunosuke. He refuses to let Tetsu hold a sword, apparently for fear that Tetsu will walk down the same bloody path as Okita. He has a deep sense of commitment to the Shinsengumi, and this is the most probable reason why he puts on a stern, unforgiving face. In Episode 7, he reprimanded Kondou for allowing the Shinsengumi to play like a 'gang of buddies' and told him to stop doing things to soften the Shinsengumi's edge. He tolerates no imperfection but is not unreasonable. As such, he has the respect of all 40 members of the Shinsengumi."

Though his skills with the katana leave much to be desired, he is practically invincible with a spear and is a master of the Taneda Houzouin-ryuu spear technique. He is a fun-loving guy that loves to eat (especially at the expense of others) and enjoys poking fun at the chibi. He, Toudou Heisuke and Nagakura Shinpachi make up the Comedian Three.\n\r\nDespite his crude, rough exterior, Sanosuke has a kind heart. He hates seeing people being bullied and will go out of his way to aid those in need (although he is also the one who stomped all over Tetsu in the first episode). Another of the first members of the Shinsengumi, he was around before the Shinsengumi moved to the capital. A little erratic, he is not someone Hijikata trusts to send on errands.\n\r\nHe will do almost anything for food, especially food cooked by Ayumu. For example, in episode 6, Sanosuke was actually trailing behind in the marathon. But when he thought about the super-size meal cooked by Ayumu (the prize) his speed increased drastically to the point whereby he caught up with Yamanami and Shinpachi, who were in the lead."

You also has a fiance, named Anna, who he saved from her destructive power of Reishi (mind-reading put simply) which is helped by Hao's old cat friend, Matamune. Matamune, however, dies drastically after saving Anna's life, giving the last bit of his energy to do this. When You was 13, he joined the Shaman Fight, with the reason to make his life a more comfortable place, for both him and Anna.\n\r\nYou himself is a pretty laid-back type of guy. He gets along with everyone around him, and making friends comes easy to him. Although he may not seem serious most of the time, he actually can get really serious when needed to be. Ironically, his twin brother, Hao is a bit like this as well, and many of You's characteristics overlap with his as well. You however, seems to be a bit more sensible than Hao since he looks at things always in a positive light and has something good to say about everything."

He is a member of the SRT (Special Response Team) of the Western Pacific Battle Group \"Tuatha de Danaan\". His call sign is Urzu-7 and his ID number is B-3128, and operates as team point-man as an Arm Slave specialist. \n\r\nIn addition to being a capable Arm Slave pilot, Sousuke is a specialist in Arm Slave operations and maintenance, improvised explosives, small arms, survival training, anti-armor combat, trap setting and camouflage. Additionally, he is proficient in logistics, demolitions, breach and forced entry, covert intrusion, and hand to hand combat. His background and experience as a guerrilla fighter, and later a mercenary soldier has made him much more sensitive and knowledgeable about tactics and methods more commonly used by guerrillas than government trained regulars. \n\r\nSousuke is unfortunately not very good at social interaction off the battlefield. He constantly causes many problems for Kaname Chidori due to his military nature. Even in school he carries a gun with him although it is loaded with non-lethal shells. He is also very bad at blending in with normal members of society due to his nature (i.e. following Kaname with stalker-like aspects and jumping off a train to follow her). That is, he has no readily available \"civil\" concepts about life, like entertainment or anything recreational and tends to horribly misinterpret the actions of people around him(like considering a guy who dumped his girlfriend a high-level tactician who is to be reckoned with). This is shown throughout the main series in multiple episodes, and the Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu! series focuses mainly on this aspect. This part of his personality is indeed one of the main sources of the series' humor. \n\r\nHis previous name during his guerrilla days was Kashim which was given to him by Majido, a strategist of the guerrilla forces in Helmajistan. \n\r\nIt is assumed that he changed his name to Sagara Sousuke when he left Helmajistan. While in Helmajistan he had a close friend named Zayid. \n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Her specialty is channeling, and she can summon a spirit from anywhere, even from heaven where normal shamans can't reach. In the English anime, she is called a \"spirit medium.\"\n\r\nAfter being abandoned by her birth parents due to her abilities, Anna was adopted by Kino Asakura. Because of this, her date of birth and blood type are unknown.\n\r\nAggressive and decisive as she is beautiful and shrewd, Anna is a pragmatic person who appears cold and harsh. However, she has shown that she genuinely cares for those important to her, especially Yoh, and merely is dedicated to be \"the ultimate Shaman Queen\" and wife to Yoh, the first true friend that she ever had in her life. She firmly believes that Yoh Asakura is destined to become the Shaman King, and thinks that it's her duty as his fianc\u00e9e to make him train hard for it.\n\r\nAnna's spiritual strength is shown as she was able to seal in Hao Asakura's guardian spirits (called as shikigami), Zenki and Kouki, and was able to control them. Anna and Hao seem to have an odd relationship of their own\u2014Anna detests Hao and even slapped him once. Surprisingly, he was not angry, but actually seemed amused. It has also been hinted that Anna is the reincarnation of the original Asakura Hao's mother from 1000 years ago, Asano-Ha; others think that Hao possibly had feelings of his own for Anna and wanted her for himself, it had not been proven false because what he said to her in the manga, he said he was serious about taking her as his bride.\n\r\nIt is obvious that Anna loves Yoh, despite how badly she seems to treat him\u2014she said it when Yoh fought the oh-oni to save her, once to his friend Manta Oyamada, and again to Silva, a commissioner for the Shaman Fight. She broke down crying when she thought that Yoh was about to be killed while being possessed by Tokagero. Anna can be extremely possessive of Yoh, beating him up once when she thought that the Oracle Bell he brought home was a woman's pager. She also reacted jealously when Yoh asked Tamao Tamamura to cook him a meal in the anime. Once, when Yoh was thought to be dead after Hao stole his soul, Anna was in hysterics, and only recovered her strength when Yoh returned. Anna attends Shinra Private Academy along with Yoh and Manta. Her favourite singer in the manga, Ringo Awaya, is a reference to Japanese singer and guitarist Shiina Ringo. Anna is also the mascot of the Aomori prefectural police Takei, Anna's creator, was born in Aomori. In Shaman King, Anna is also born in Aomori.\n\nAnna is married to Yoh and the two of them have a son six years old named Hana Asakura."

            "description": "Ren is a shaman from China who came to Japan to fight Yoh Asakura and to take part in the Shaman Fight in Tokyo. In the American dub this is never mentioned. Ren starts off as a 13-year-old in the manga and the original Japanese anime, while in the English anime he first appears as a 15-year-old.\n\r\nHe is serious, logical, and emotionally aloof. He has become like this because of how he was raised. Because of his father, Ren had adapted a deep hatred towards humanity and a strong yearning to eliminate them all. He also believed that his spirit companion, Bason, was only meant to be used as a tool and to treat him as a friend would only result in the spirit taking advantage over him. Ren's anger and hatred came from his father (or uncle in the English anime), Tao Y\u00faan (Tao En). Forced to train and study at a very young age, Ren had his childhood stolen from him. He hated Tao En for all of his suffering.\n\r\nAs he gains the friendship of Yoh and the others, he realizes that everything he once believed about the world was not true. He learned to trust others and that humans weren't as awful as he thought they were because Yoh and the others showed him that some people truly are kind. A new will to change himself took over. He wanted to let go of his hatred so he could be able to move on with his life, so he returned to China to defeat his father.\n\r\nHis first attempt failed, but he refused to give in to his father, even as he remained chained in the dungeon of his home. Thanks to Bason, Yoh and the others came to help him. He thanked them for rescuing him but was persistent in saying that he didn't want any help from them. He said it was his problem alone. But eventually all of them defeated Tao Y\u00faan together; allowing Ren to finally move on.\n\r\nRen tries hard to maintain a tough and confident exterior and is aloof, but deep down would risk his life for his allies. Ren is a particularly impatient person with a very short temper, and isn't afraid to hurt the source of the anger.\n\r\nRen is an egotistical person and usually doesn't care that people think that he's overly proud. He even named his own team, \"Team the Ren,\" much to the annoyance of his teammate, Horohoro. His overflowing self-confidence annoys some of the other characters. In addition, Ren is also very intuitive, quick-witted, and sometimes stubborn. He is also very defiant. He rarely listens to what anyone says or takes their instructions. Before and during the process in which he befriended Yoh, he even was bold enough to disobey his father on various occasions.\n\r\nIt is mentioned that Ren is skilled in more than one area of combat. Not only is he a powerful shaman capable of doing things most shamans his age would not be able to, but in addition, he also seems to be skilled in martial arts and sword fighting, in addition to also learning many of Mikihisa Asakura's techniques simply by experiencing them firsthand. It is also lightly suggested in the manga that Ren can also play the erhu.\n\r\nAs the series progresses, Ren begins to trust others more. Out of all his friends, his bonds with Yoh and Horohoro seem to be the strongest. Ren often fights with Horohoro and the two do not seem to get along at all. However, after Ren sacrifices himself to save him, it becomes apparent that they really do care for one another. As Faust worked to try to save Ren's life after the incident, Horohoro did his best to protect the unconscious Ren.\n\r\nRen's name in Chinese means \"benevolent,\" \"tough,\" and \"edge of a knife,\" all of which are reflected in his character. His actual Chinese name, Li\u00e1n, means \"lotus\". In the English dub, he is given a British accent. He also has an obsession with milk and the number 3.\n\r\nHis Furyoku is 100,001 (as seen in chapter 276)\n\r\nIn Shaman King Character Book, there was an interview asking what kind of girl he likes and he said he would only like a girl if she's smaller than him and not annoying. This must be the reason why he married Iron Maiden Jeanne and had a son named Men Tao.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

They lead happy lives without even trying. Ridiculous, isn't it?\"\n\r\nAsakura Hao is the main antagonist in Shaman King. He was born Asaha Douji in Japan during the Heian era. During his third life he becomes the twin brother of his descendant Asakura Yoh. His name translates to Leaf King. He is the most powerful shaman in the entirety of the series. His childhood is told in the manga side story Mappa Douji.\n\r\nDuring his first life, Asakura Hao was constantly surrounded by the horrors of war and thus saw the world as a grim and dark place, until he met the small demon Ohachiyo, who taught him all the positive aspects of life. However, after an accident involving Hao's first Over Soul, Ohachiyo became a permanent part of Hao and cursed him with the very dangerous ability of Reishi. As he grew into an adult Hao became a relatively peaceful man who sought to help the people around him, and thanks to him the Asakura Family prospered. It was because of this gentle and kind nature that he took in the cat Matamune, who wound up becoming what he considered his \"only friend.\"\n\r\nHowever, his Reishi abilities became too strong and eventually went beyond his control. The negative emotions and thoughts of others were constantly overwhelming him and, since he was unable to turn his Reishi off, the deluge of negativity eventually created a demon inside his own heart. The internal confusion and disorder that was also created eventually led to his desire of creating a Shaman only Kingdom on earth and drove him to become the Shaman King in order to reach this goal.\n\r\nIn his third and most current incarnation, Hao is usually calm, cruel, and all smiles. The occasions when he is really angry are very rare and when he is angry with someone, that person is usually killed and burned to their soul by The Spirit Of Fire. He also likes to watch Shaman Fights, particularly those that involve strong Shaman, and Asakura Yoh. He is not only interested in that, but also claims that when Yoh reached his limit, he will eat him to become the strongest Shaman.\n\r\nHe has shown some dislike of being given family titles, as he glared at Yoh in the last chapter when the latter called him \"Nii-chan,\" and his face darkened when his nephew, Asakura Hana, called him Uncle Hao. Both times he told the person not to call him that."

Horohoro's main goal in the Shaman Fight is to save the Koro Pokkuru (\"Minutians\" in the English anime), a tiny spirit people. As part of this goal, he intends to plant a vast field of Butterbur. His guardian ghost is Kororo (\"Corey\" in the English anime), a spirit who is smitten with Manta Oyamada. Also in the manga, he becomes the third strongest of the Five Elemental Warriors and gains the Spirit of Rain. His furyoku is 120,000 (as seen in chapter 276). This, oddly, makes him \"technically\" stronger than both Yoh and Tao Ren, who have more importance in the series than him, who only have 108,000 and 100,001 furyoku respectively.\n\nHorohoro is good-natured and cheerful, but he gets serious in dangerous situations. He argues constantly with his teammate Tao Ren, and they do not seem to get along at all. However, it is shown that he really does care for him when, in the manga, he tells Yoh Asakura that if he can't save Ren, as his friend, HoroHoro would never forgive him. Horohoro is also very secretive about his past not willing to talk about it even to his friends. In addition, Horohoro can also get very competitive, even going so far as to turn Ryu's arms to ice and shatter them during the fight between The Ren and Funbari Onsen. Horohoro's name sounds and is spelled (in Katakana) like \"boroboro,\" which means \"crap.\" Characters mispronouncing/misspelling his name is a running gag in the series. It's later reveled that Horohoro's real name is Usui Horokeu.\n\nIn Shaman King: Kang Zeng Bang, Invading plants, he got furious by Kalim mentioning his true name. He claimed that he threw that name because that was the named that killed the girl he loved. It was revealed that Damuko, Horohoro's childhood friend and crush, was actually Kororo.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He is very expressive and a bit panicky. His rather abnormal height has gotten him into trouble numerous times, once having been mistaken for one of the shy nature spirits, and being cut open and used as a hostage of sorts during Yoh Asakura's match with Faust VIII. In the anime, during the final battle with Hao, he actually becomes a Shaman and is able to merge with a spirit. His weapon is a hammer and his unofficial guardian ghost is Mosuke, the best friend of Amidamaru who forged his sword, the Harusame. After that episode in the anime, Manta is able to junction spirits to his laptop. He narrates the story in the manga and anime, allowing readers and watchers to understand the plot more efficiently. He is referred to as \"Morty\" (short for Mortimer) in the English anime. (Hiroyuki Takei mentioned Manta's character was modelled after Japanese pop singer T.M.Revolution in an interview published in the March 2004 English language issue of Sh\u014dnen Jump.)\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Ayumu is also the supposed only hope for the Blade Children and their survival. \r\n(Source: Wikipedia)\nIn the manga, it is later revealed he is the clone of Kiyotaka- and thus has a shorter lifespan.

Her skill with computers are as amazing as her hacking abilities and she has access to over one hundred resources. She blackmails Wataya often, and is very fond of Ayumu's cooking.

However, on the occasions when Tomo has actually been inspired to concentrate on something, she has demonstrated that she is quite capable. She succeeded in gaining the grades needed to qualify for the same high school as Yomi, though Yomi ridiculed her and openly said that there was no way that she could do so.

She is the voice of reason of the series, carrying herself as the most mature and serious of the group. Though smart and athletic, she is constantly dissatisfied with herself due to her weight and is always trying various diets in an effort to become thinner. She can never seem to stick to these diets however, as she finds herself constantly tempted by her favorite foods. Another weakness of Yomi's character is that while she is above average in everything else, Yomi is an awful singer, but karaoke is one of her favorite pastimes. While usually functioning as Tomo's \"straight man\", she sometimes manifests a rather cruel sense of humor. Yomi also has an uppercut that Tomo is usually on the receiving end of whenever she pushes Yomi too far. However, even though she likes to think that she is well above the childish behavior of some of her classmates, Yomi has demonstrated in the story that she can be just like the rest of the characters on certain occasions, such as trying to get Chiyo to infuse a shrine charm with some of her intelligence so that she could pass her college entrance exams.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Ayumu considers the name \"slow\" and \"spacey\", but she lacks the energy or motivation to dispute it. The nickname sticks so well that she is called Osaka by teachers and even in the class roster, to the point that no one remembers her real name. In the manga, Osaka mentions that she lived in Kobe when she was in elementary school and was born in Wakayama. Tomo, who says she doesn't know where Wakayama is, tells Ayumu to \"just be Osaka\". \n\nDespite the fact that her non sequiturs and tendency to nod off during lectures upset Yukari, she remains in Yukari's homeroom class all three years. Because of her poor performance on exams, she is a member of the \"Bonkuras\" (translated as \"Knuckleheads\" in the anime and \"Numbnuts\" in the manga). Her decision, on Chiyo's advice, to seek a teaching career after graduation is viewed by Yukari as a deep personal insult. \r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Occasionally, such as when he is attacking oni, Haruka can transfigure into his true youkai form. His nails grow sharper and longer, his fangs grow longer, and his eyes constrict. Usually, he appears as a tall, dark-haired man with black wings that he can either hide or reveal. Haruka is troubled by his lack of memories, inability to eat youkai, and loss of power, which starts to affect his sense of self. Haruka's name under his previous master, an onmyodo practitioner, was Rin. As Rin, he did not have a good relationship with his master, and it is hinted that she took advantage of his subservient status for sexual purposes.\n\r\nSource: Wikipedia."

By using a special trick, Yukito is able to move his puppet without strings. He uses this to make money as he travels, with most of it going toward food.\n\nOne day, Yukito arrives in a small town by the sea. Quickly deciding not to stay very long, he heads for the beach in an attempt to make some money. While by the beach, he meets a strange girl named Misuzu who quickly invites him to her house for dinner and, although skeptical, he accepts. Soon after meeting her mother Haruko and becoming friends with them, he is convinced into staying there. Yukito soon begins doing odd jobs for the local clinic after the doctor catches him doing his puppet show outside. It is here that Yukito becomes friends with Kano and Minagi; however, after getting to know them better he learns of their problems, which convinces Yukito to stay and help.\n\nAfter helping Kano and Minagi, Yukito finds out about Misuzu's illness, which is where she is unable to make friends because she'll begin crying uncontrollably. Yukito then leaves, deciding that if he leaves, Misuzu will get better; however, as he is about to leave, Yukito realizes his mistake and goes back to help. Here is when he realizes his and Misuzu's connection to the past and that Misuzu is the re-incarnation of the Winged Maiden. When Yukito finds Misuzu, she tells him of her last dream before falling asleep. Yukito then disappears in a bright light, causing Misuzu to wake up, seemingly better.\n\nIt is implied that when Sora appears in the anime after Yukito's disappearance, Sora is Yukito or contains a part of Yukito's soul.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

With an obsession with dinosaurs (which goes back to her childhood), she finds it difficult to make friends and is constantly left alone. Because of Misuzu's fondness of dinosaurs, she uses the word \"Gao\" frequently, which is the noise she thought dinosaurs made when she was young. Even though Misuzu's foster mother scolds her whenever she utters it, Misuzu constantly disregards the warning and continues using it in her everyday speech.\n\nOne day, Misuzu resolves to make a friend, and after meeting Yukito, invites him over to dinner. Although Haruko disapproves of him at first, they all eventually become friends and Yukito is invited to stay. While playing cards one night, Misuzu suddenly cries without reason. Haruko soon explains that Misuzu has a condition where she cries uncontrollably when she comes close to making friends. Haruko brought her to a clinic and to a big hospital hoping it would help, but it didn't work. It was a mental instability, but the doctors said she would slowly recover as she got older. Misuzu's condition begins to worsen, prompting Yukito to leave. He soon discovers that Misuzu is related to a childhood tale he heard, and that she is the descendant of the Winged-Maiden in the tale, who has been cursed to eternal pain.\n\r\nMisuzu soon becomes ill; she becomes childlike and has to use a wheelchair. As a result, Haruko tries to adopt Misuzu officially. Unfortunately, before she is able to do so, Misuzu's biological father comes to take her with him; however, when he tries to leave with her, Misuzu refuses, calling Haruko \"Mama.\"\n\r\nEven though Misuzu stays with Haruko, her condition doesn't improve, and when Yukito returns, she is in constant pain. In the final episode, Misuzu asks that they all go to the beach together and when they get there, Misuzu attempts to walk to Haruko and Yukito, calling them \"her goal.\" Sadly, when Misuzu does reach them, she collapses and dies in Haruko's arms, ending the curse placed on the Winged Maiden.\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)"

He is often referred to as by his last name, though his companions have made up nicknames for him, such as \"Mi-chan\" or \"Mi-bo\". \n\r\nDespite the difference in his age in the anime and manga, Tokiya wanted to take Yanagi from Recca because she looks exactly like his sister, Mifuyu Mikagami, who was murdered in front of his eyes when he was young. He uses the Hyomon Ken style which was developed specifically for the Ensui and the Hyoma En (a madogu that also controls water, but focuses more on water in its solid form). Tokiya joins forces with Recca in attempting to rescue Yanagi from Mori Koran's mansion, and he continues to be part of their team throughout the rest of the series.\n\r\nTokiya in both the anime and manga is initially portrayed as callous and aloof; often insulting his teammates' abilities and intelligence. He is protective of Yanagi, who closely resembles late sister, and he is shown to be interested in her romantically in the manga. Other characters have often praise Tokiya for his intellect and composure during battle, with some going as far as to say that he might be the strongest Hokage member when it comes to normal battles. Another characteristic of his that makes him stand out among his teammates is the fact that he is more ruthless and cruel than the rest, a fact recognized by both Kurei and Mikoto, who both act as antagonists throughout most of the manga.\n\r\nCertain characteristics in Tokiya's personality and appearance are different in the anime series as opposed to the manga and games. His hair is light blue in the manga and games, and brown in the anime series. In the booklet accompanying the Flame of Recca Original Soundtrack Vol. 2 CD, his age is listed as 17, while the filler page in the manga states that he is 16 years of age. Apart from these differences, Tokiya's character development in the anime is not as obvious as it is in the manga, wherein he becomes more open to emotions other than his desire for vengeance towards the end of the series. Tokiya attributes this change to his encounter with Kai, a fellow Hyomon Ken practitioner, and his friends."

The series depicts her as extremely diligent, although she is also a natural genius.\n\r\nAs the series progresses, she learns to understand her mistakes and not think that she has to be perfect or else fail. For instance, after a rocky start to her training, during which she was dead last in her class at piloting, she takes the advice of Kouta Otoyama and realizes she was trying to keep track of far too much information on her ship displays. Her piloting improves dramatically as a result. Despite her early setbacks as a pilot, her programming abilities are top notch from the very start, and she eventually combines the two in order to become even more formidable in the cockpit. She is called Shipon because the first time she piloted one of the Biancas she flew around like a ping-pong ball.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He has an older sister who runs an astronomical observatory in Japan. He often gives advice which is as enigmatic as himself.\r\nHe consistently achieves rank C in every class, without exception, regardless of how easy or hard the subject is. And when he was warned of the possibility of Ayaka attacking Shipon during training, he displays extraordinary piloting abilities beyond what his ship should have been capable of handling. Another example would be during a simulator-game where Rinna scored Rank A, Shima scored Rank B, he had scores Rank S. When Shima asks why Kouta does not do the best during class, especially since he is capable of it, he merely says: he wonders why also. Pierre once remarks \"Talented hawks hide their talons\" when referring to Kouta's skills.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Although he does not practice any specific martial arts style, few people are able to match him in hand-to-hand combat. He has the ability to communicate with animals, and possesses a wide variety of strange and exotic pets which he named after European monarchs. He has a little brother, Shuuji, who likes Yakumo.\n\nHarima struggles often to confess to Tenma, though he knows she has absolutely no feelings for him and may even dislike him. Every time Harima finds the courage to tell Tenma his true feelings, something happens which prevents him from succeeding. Harima also must deal with situations involving his classmate Eri, unaware of the fact that she does not know whether to like or dislike him. He gets extremely jealous seeing Karasuma and Tenma together, but his attempts to put a stop to that usually end up bringing them closer. Ironically, Harima admires Nij\u014d j\u014d(\u4e8c\u6761\u4e08) the mangaka, which is Karasuma's pen name. To date, Tenma has yet to hear his confession properly. He also works as a mangaka, having Yakumo as his assistant, creating another source of misunderstandings, as it took a long time for Tenma to realize that their relationship is only professional, at least by Harima's side.\n\nIn the manga School Rumble Z last chapter, Harima is seen walking in the hospital room (where the Karasuma is) together with Eri, who is holding a baby and with a blushing face."

She has great difficulty with Kanji. Eri is extremely wealthy and somewhat spoiled (Western Europeans in Japan are stereotyped to be billionaires and extremely snobby). Eri is devoted to her father, but cannot spend as much time with him as she wants because of his work commitments.\n\nShe is attracted to Harima, becoming very jealous and angry towards anyone rumored to date him. This even causes some strains in her relationships with Mikoto and Yakumo. Eri was unaware of Harima's true love interest for a long time and came to the realization on the night of her birthday party. After witnessing his happiness whenever he is alone with Tenma. Even so, they do a fake marriage on paper for her family status at the end of the manga and  is constantly seen with Harima, implying a possible relationship.\n\nIn \"School Rumble Z\" she works as a stewardess and still seems to be looking for Harima. In the last chapter, she is seen walking into Karasuma's hospital room with Harima, while holding a baby. This presumably refers to that she has gotten married with Harima."

Not only is she able to read the thoughts of those who like her (as well as her sister and pet cat Iori), but further in the story it is shown that she also has the ability to communicate with ghosts.\n\r\nSkilled, reliable, smart, and beautiful, Yakumo is one of the most admired girls in the school. Despite that fact, she has never had a boyfriend. This is due mostly to her mind-reading ability, as she can easily read the secret intentions of any boy who tries to approach her. The only exception is Harima, whose heart belongs completely to another girl; thus, his mind is completely opaque to her. Even though Yakumo is the younger sister of the Tsukamoto family, she handles most of the household chores. She is also a member of the Tea Club.\n\nYakumo eventually grows a strong friendship with Harima; which leads him to trust her with the critiquing of his manga drafts and keeping his pastime a secret. Eventually she takes on the task of assisting him on the actual inking of pages, which causes them to spend many hours together alone. Yakumo eventually develops deeper feelings for Harima than just the master-apprentice relationship. She keeps them hidden from him however, as she realizes he is in love with her sister."

Shigure is one of the oldest members of the Sohma family.  He is laid-back and anything but solemn. He is somewhat of a pervert, and as a writer of both romance novels and academic books.  Occasionally, Shigure shows that he has another side to himself. He can be surprisingly mature, thoughtful, and gives rather sage and insightful advice to Tooru, Kyo, Yuki, and other characters, acting like an actual \"adult.\"\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

She is then found by Shigure and Yuki, who offer to take her in in exchange for housekeeping. She loves to cook and describes herself as an excellent housekeeper. She also has an after-school job as a janitor to pay her tuition fees to avoid being a burden on her grandfather. She is depicted as polite, optimistic, extremely kind, and selfless; several other characters, including Kyou, Rin and Hanajima, tell her she needs to look out for her own interests and not shoulder everyone else's burdens.\n\r\nTooru habitually speaks formally (see Honorific speech in Japanese), but not always correctly, a habit she picked up from her father, Katsuya, after he died when she was three, as a way of replacing him in her mother's eyes. Tooru's mother, Kyoko, raised her alone until she died in a car accident shortly after Tooru entered high school, a few months before the start of the story. Tooru repeatedly calls Kyoko the most important person in her life and treasures her photograph; when she falls in love with Kyou she feels guilty of being \"unfaithful\" to her mother's memory.\n\r\nIn the first half of the series, as Tooru learns about the zodiac curse and its effects on those she loves, she becomes distressed, and when she learns that the dangerous Akito is the \"god\" of the zodiac, she resolves to break the curse. Only later does she admit that she wants to free Kyou most of all. Despite setbacks, she stubbornly persists in her goal and eventually frees Kyou and her friends.\n\nIn the last chapter, she begins moving with Kyou to another city so he can continue his martial arts training, and in the final pages they are shown as a loving elderly couple with a granddaughter.\nNote: \"Tooru Honda\" is the correct spelling of this name per Hepburn romanization, which is used as a MyAnimeList standard. Please do not submit changes for the name."

He wishes that he could be with people as friends, rather than admired and worshiped from afar. Yuki has suffered a traumatic childhood at the hands of Akito, the head of the Sohma clan, who locked up and mentally tortured him. Because of this, Yuki has a somewhat low sense of worth and is claustrophobic. With Tooru's help, however, Yuki is gradually able to loosen up. He is jealous of Kyo because he thinks Kyo can have a normal life, which Yuki always wanted.\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He is easily provoked and angered in any situation. As with most of the Sohma clan, Kyou is cursed with becoming an animal of the Zodiac when hugged by someone of the opposite gender. His Zodiac animal is the cat which, in legend, was barred from becoming one of the official twelve animals because of the rat's trickery. Kyou hates the current rat of the family, Yuki, as a result. The two constantly fight and Kyou loses every time.\n\r\nEver since he met Honda Tooru, who admires the cat of Zodiac legend, he has expressed a soft side of himself. Kyou was always separated from the Sohma clan, including his parents, which is likely the cause of his short-fused temperament and stubbornness. He constantly trains in martial arts so that he might one day defeat his rival, Yuki. His martial arts master is one of the people he respects the most."

He is generally a laid-back, jovial fellow, although he can be dead serious when the situation warrants it. Despite his carefree attitude, his speech is always polite, though it is sometimes sarcastic. Yoruichi Shihouin notes that he tends to go over the top with whatever he becomes passionate about. He once described himself as a \"mere honest, handsome, perverted businessman.\" During the Bount arc of the anime, when Ganju Shiba calls Urahara an \"old man,\" Urahara replies that he is the same age as Ganju's sister, K\u016bkaku Shiba. \n\nUrahara can usually be found near the scene of an important event, but will rarely step in to intervene, preferring to be in control from outside. After the event is over (i.e. the battle between Ichigo Kurosaki and Renji Abarai), he kindly pops up and helps the side he deems fit. Thus far, it has tended to be the side of the protagonists. He often tends to know more than he reveals and tends to have some form of relationship with most of the story's characters. While he is a major driving force throughout much of the story, he is usually only the catalyst, allowing others to do the work for him. Despite his appearance, Urahara is a highly skilled fighter, using a combination of powerful attacks and cunning deceptions, and is capable of holding his own against Espada-level arrancar with nothing more than his shikai. He also likes building large underground training spaces in secret. He built the first one under the S\u014dkyoku hill in Soul Society with Yoruichi for their training, and created a second one under his shop in the mortal realm for a similar purpose.He is also the former captain of squad 12 until he designed the Orb of Distortion.This is able to create Vizards(Soul Reapers with hollow powers).\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He does read the newspaper, though\nDislikes: Rain. Just about anything he finds annoying. And cats\n\r\nSanzou is a handsome creature that is anything but the traditional Buddhist monk. He is ill-tempered, swears, eats meat, drinks, and is usually seen with a cigarette hanging from his lips. Sanzou is the bearer of the Maten scripture, which allows him to banish demons. Sanzou also possesses a Smith & Wesson shoureijuu [banishing gun] which he is often seen wielding in battle. At the start of the story, he was bidden by the Three Aspects to journey to India with his three companions to stop the resurrection of the demon King Gyuumaou.\n\nBackstory\n\r\nBefore Sanzou was bestowed his present title, he was known as Kouryuu, the river orphan. He was found by his mentor Koumyou Sanzou when he was just a baby, abandoned to float downstream. Koumyou raised and taught him, and was held by Kouryuu in high regard.\r\nShortly after Kouryuu was named as Koumyou's successor, Koumyou was killed while protecting Kouryuu from demons that were raiding their temple looking for the holy scriptures. They succeeded in stealing the Seiten Scripture that Koumyou bore, but left behind the Maten Scripture. The young Genjou Sanzou subsequently went on a search to recover his master's stolen scripture, but was unsuccessful. Several years later, he came under the employ of the Three Aspects in order for them to help him in his task.\n\r\nAlthough he remembers his master fondly, Sanzou is often haunted by the memory of Koumyou's death. He despises the rain due to the fact that it poured down on the night of his master's death, and often broods whenever it falls from the sky, usually refusing to go out into it. Despite the fact that Sanzou's abilities are undeniable, he often feels as though he is unworthy of the title that his master bestowed upon him, but yet strives to become strong enough to one day see himself as deserving of it.\n\r\nIn his previous life, Sanzou was the god Konzen Douji, the nephew of the Merciful Goddess Kanzeon, who is often seen watching over him and his group from her place in heaven. He was an ill-tempered bureaucrat who had no joy or excitement in his immortal life until it was turned upside down by being named the caretaker of the young Son Gokuu. He subsequently became very attached to his charge, albeit reluctantly.\r\n(Source: Saiyuki Fansite f a t e d, Saiyuki Wikia)"

(Appears 18)\nBirthday: April 5\nSign: Aries\nBlood Type: O\nHeight: 162 cm (5'4)\nWeight: 51 kg (112 lbs.)\nHair: Brown\nEyes: Gold\nHobbies: Eating, fighting, being with Sanzou\nDislikes: Being alone, being hungry\n\r\nPerpetually hungry, energetic and playful, Gokuu is the constant companion by Sanzou's side, viewing him as the 'sun' that his world revolves around. He is actually neither demon nor human, but is a heretic that was given birth by the Earth itself. He is very fast as well as strong, and uses his nyoibou [an extendable staff] to fight demons in battle. He accompanied Sanzou on his journey, and is often seen trading insults with Gojyo or fighting with him over food. The diadem that Gokuu wears on his head is actually a limiter to suppress his true form, the Seiten Taisei, or the Sage Equal to Heaven. When in this form, Gokuu is incredibly powerful and nearly unstoppable. He usually can't distinguish between friend or foe in this form, and often turns his attack toward his companions. Sanzou is capable of conjuring Gokuu's limiter in the event that it breaks.\n\nHe is also known as the monkey king.\n\r\nAlthough Gokuu has a youthful appearance, he is actually over 500 years old. Previously, he was taken from where he dwelled on Earth into Heaven due to his potential danger. Shortly after his arrival, he was placed under the care of the god Konzen Douji, who he was drawn to because of his great beauty and golden hair that reminded Gokuu of the sun in the world below. Gokuu soon befriended the war prince Nataku as well as Konzen's friend Tenpou and his companion General Kenren.\n\r\nUnfortunately, Gokuu became embroiled in the politics of Heaven. Due to the stress of certain events, Gokuu's limiter broke, causing him to revert to his true form. He killed a number of gods who tried to attack him, and his three friends Konzen, Tenpou, and Kenren, took him and fled. After the deaths of Gokuu's companions [the circumstances of which have yet to be revealed], his memories were sealed and he was imprisoned on Earth at the base of a mountain for his crimes against Heaven. Centuries later, Genjou Sanzou was drawn to the place that Gokuu was imprisoned by the sound of his 'voice.' The monk reached out to Gokuu, and the chains that bound him and the bars that confined him vanished. Since then, Gokuu has always been at Sanzou's side, not realizing that he has been reunited with the caretaker that he adored so long ago, as well as the two friends that he lost.\r\n(Source: Saiyuuki Fansite, Saiyuuki Wikia)"

He is capable of channeling his chi into powerful bursts of energy in battle, and can also form it into a shield to protect himself or his friends. He wears three ear cuffs that are his limiters. When removed, his true power is released. He can often dispatch demons much larger than himself or numerous foes in this form. Hakkai is often reluctant to do so due to the possible danger to his friends. Hakkai is the member of the four journeying with Sanzou that tends to mother the others [for lack of a better term], cleaning up after them, shopping, etc. The jeep that the group of four is driven in by Hakkai is actually his small magical dragon companion, Hakuryu.\n\nLong before the journey to the west, Hakkai was known as the human Cho Gonou, an orphan who later met and married his older sister Cho Kanan. He was a teacher in the village that they later lived in together. One day, Gonou returned from work to find that the townspeople had given his wife as an offering to the centipede demon Hyakuganmaou because they saw her as the most expendible of the women, being without relatives. Enraged, Gonou slaughtered a large number of townsfolk before journeying to the demon's castle. There he killed every demon he found single-handedly. Coming upon the imprisoned Kanan, he wanted to free her and take her home with him. She informed him that she couldn't leave with him, since she had been raped and impregnated by the demon king. Using Gonou's blade, she killed herself in front of her husband.\n\r\nThe distraught Cho Gonou was come upon by the remaining son of Hyakuganmaou, Chin Yisou, who attacked him, slicing his belly. Wanting to find out whether or not a tale that he'd heard was true, Chin Yisou dripped his own blood into Gonou's wound. Having now bathed in the blood of 1,000 demons, Gonou became one, killing Yisou before leaving the castle.\n\r\nThe wounded Cho Gonou was saved physically by the half-demon Sha Gojou, and spiritually by Genjo Sanzou, taking the new name Cho Hakkai as a symbol of his rebirth. He and Gojou became very good friends due to their experiences together before the journey to the west. Many times, Hakkai still reflects on his past pain, and his memories of Kanan are bittersweet.\n\r\nIn his previous life, Hakkai was a god in Heaven. He was known as Field Marshall Tenpou, an eccentric military man who was fond of his library of books, many of which were about the world below. He could often be found with his nose in a book [or buried under them] in his library. He was the friend of Konzen Douji as well as his subordinate General Kenren. He and Kenren were fairly inseparable and had an easy-going relationship despite their difference in rank. Their soon to be enemy Li Touten [father of Nataku], referred to Kenren as Tenpou's 'husband' at one point. Although Tenpou tended to be mild-mannered, when provoked he was not to be taken lightly and would fiercely defend those that he cared about, qualities that he carried over into his next life. The god's weapon of choice was the katana.\r\n(Source: Saiyuki Fansite, Saiyuki Wikia)"

He is often teased by Goku and Sanzou due to his lecherous behavior. However, he is a loyal and reliable friend who has a soft spot for women in danger who are in need of help. He is a half-demon, which granted him his red hair and exotic red eyes. His weapon in battle is a jakujou [a staff with a crescent-moon shaped blade attached to the end by a chain that can be elongated].\n\nWhen he was a boy, Gojou lived in a rather unhappy home. His demon father had had an affair with a human. His father later dumped his illegitimate child on his demon wife before abandoning her. His stepmother is the only mother that Gojou ever knew. She often took out her frustrations on Gojou, physically and mentally abusing him while weeping for herself and her situation. Gojou's demon older brother Jien would often try to protect Gojou from his mother's rage. No matter how hard Gojou tried, he was unable to win his mother's affection, and was tormented as much by the sight of her tears as he was by the fact that she professed love solely for his older brother.\n\r\nOne day, Gojou's mother had reached her limits, and attempted to kill Gojou, first scarring the side of his face with her claws, then attempting to strangle him. Gojou was saved by his older brother Jien, who tearfully killed his mother before fleeing, leaving Gojou alone. Gojou later made his way in the world by first being involved in shady activity with his friend Banri before mastering gambling at cards. He survived the loneliness of the nights by bedding loose women. He used to despise his red hair, since it represented the things that his mother had hated about him.\n\r\nOne night on his way back from a bar, Gojou came upon the bleeding form of Cho Gonou. He soon took the unconscious man back to his home and nursed him back to health. He was the first one that Gonou confessed his crimes to, bonding with the troubled newly-born demon over their different yet shared pain. Gojou tried to protect Gonou from Sanzou when the monk came to bring Gonou back with him for judgment. After Gonou left with Sanzou, who later informed him that Gonou had 'died,' Gojou cut off his long locks as a sign of mourning. He was later reunited with Gonou, now Cho Hakkai. The two of them became good friends and roommates before embarking on the journey with Sanzou several years later.\n\r\nWhen Gojou previously lived in the world, he was known as General Kenren, a boisterous and flirtatious raven-haired god who lacked respect for all of his superior officers other than his friend Tenpou. He was fond of women, but was even fonder of sake, which he was often found sipping while lounging in one of the sakura trees in Heaven. Kenren was usually the one to ruffle the feathers of his superior officers, with Tenpou examining the results.\r\n(Source: Saiyuki Fansite f a t e d, Saiyuki Wikia)"

She is a rather naive young girl. Risa starts to develop a crush, then an obsession, with Dark upon seeing his attempt to steal an artwork broadcast over the news claiming that he is the mysterious person whom she is destined to be with.\n\r\nThere is an ongoing sisterly rivalry between her and Riku. Compared to her sister she seems more innocent and clumsier and can be seen as your typical \"girly-girl\" though shows the same stubbornness, tenacity, and kindness as Riku. She would much rather prefer fashion and relationships than to physical activities. In terms of physical features her hair is much longer and she has a \"softer voice,\" apart from that the two can't be distinguished (shown in episode 5 of the anime when the two switch places so Risa can get out of chopping cabbage as a form of after school punishment).\n\r\nRisa obsessively pursues Dark, coming up with intricate schemes and plans to make him go out with her, some of which eventually work. There's no doubt that she is quite clever and very persistent. Later on, however, Dark tells her that the two of them cannot see each other anymore. Near the end of the anime, subtle signs of a relationship between Risa and Satoshi start to show. (example: he places her on a park bench and covers her body with his jacket after she fell unconscious during their struggles with Krad. She then wakes up only to find the jacket and a single white feather which fell from it. Although not knowing who the jacket and feather belongs to, she can be seen treasuring it). In the manga this is more apparent, shown through small occurrences (example: he saves her when she fell off a building, when Daisuke saves her from drowning he shows concern and touches a lock of her hair).\n\r\nAs the series progresses, Risa breaks out of being a naive little girl and develops into a more mature young lady."

Unlike her younger sister Risa, who prefers fashion and obsessing over relationships, Riku is more into athletics (lacrosse being her sport of choice) and academics and can be considered to be somewhat of a tomboy. She acts \"less girly\" compared to her sister Risa and is more serious, independent and down-to-earth. In terms of physical features, her hair is much shorter (about shoulder length) than her sister's and she displays more stamina and fitness (Risa is chauffeured to the train station then rides Riku's bike to school compared to Riku riding her bike to meet her sister then jogging the rest of the way). She is also kind and caring and very outspoken and selfless, only wanting the best for everyone and willing to help those in need.\n\r\nShe holds an intense dislike for Dark Mousy ever since their first encounter in which he had spotted her after she was done taking a shower then stealing her first kiss. In the anime, he landed on her balcony as she stood outside. Upon seeing him she was startled and in his attempts to quiet her down as to not attract attention he kissed her. In the manga, the same thing happened when he hid in her room escaping from the police and she woke up. The fact that Dark stole her first kiss added to her extreme dislike of him."

He is extremely intelligent and has a college degree. However, he attends Daisuke's Junior High School in an attempt to have a normal life. He acts as the police commander in charge of capturing Dark.\n\r\nDue to his family legacy, he is almost obsessive in his attempts to capture Dark. He is the sole living member of the Hikari family, whose artworks are almost always Dark's targets for stealing. Satoshi recreates one of Daisuke's paintings during the incident with the Toki no Byuushin, claiming that he can mimic any piece if he sees it once. His reproduction is a precise imitation, impossible to tell from the original.\n\r\nHe was adopted by a 26-year-old police officer by the name of Hiwatari, and so his name was changed to reflect his adoption. During the course of the story, he begins to care more about Daisuke's safety. It appears that Daisuke is the trigger for Satoshi's other personality, Krad, to appear. Satoshi opposes Krad taking control of his body greatly, and has taken on an uncaring personality to \"seal his heart,\" and thus, Krad. Krad is Dark's \"evil twin,\" or opposite, a homicidal blond whose only motivation seems to be getting rid of Dark."

With (Wiz) absolutely despises Krad and always tries to attack him on sight. Krad can be called insanely obsessive, as he attempts to kill Daisuke after their first encounter because he is very possessive over his host, Satoshi, and does not let him get close to anyone. He affectionately calls him, \"My everything.\" Satoshi, however\u2014like his whole family generation\u2014despises Krad.\n\r\nUnlike Dark, Krad does not use any wings other than his own and is entirely willing to utilize his magic, thus demonstrating his lack of care for his host's wellbeing. Although feelings of love are what cause Daisuke to transform into Dark, it seems that Krad can force his way out of Satoshi at any moment. This fact may be due to Krad's greater willingness to injure his host, since it makes little sense for Daisuke to be triggered by love and Satoshi to have no triggers. Likewise, Satoshi can most times force Krad back inside his body. One very popular nickname for Krad is Homicidal Blond. Krad has no last name, but only he calls Dark with Mousy attached. He uses it to express how he feels about Dark..."

He is calm and collective most of the time, buthis attitude tends to change whenever Yuzuki is around, and is prone to outbursts whenever she is in trouble, much like Hideki when Chii is in trouble. He is also a very forgiving character, always telling Yuzuki that it is not her fault whenever something goes wrong."

He is 38 years old, although he looks as though he is only in his mid-20's, at one point noting jokingly that he has a \"baby face\". He, too, has suffered a trauma involving persocoms. \n\nWhen he first opened his bakery, he bought a persocom to help with math and accounting, which he admits he is terrible at. He eventually fell in love with this persocom and then married her, but she developed a hard disk fault which resulted in the gradual degradation of her memory, until she remembered almost nothing at all.\n\nRarely, she would suddenly recall small fragments of memories from her life with Hiroyasu. He could not bring himself to have her repaired because her memories might be lost completely in the process of transferring them to a new hard drive, and he felt she would not be the same person if this happened. Soon, her memory degraded to the point that she could not remember anything for more than a few seconds at a time, and Hiroyasu had keep a constant watch on her to prevent her from wandering away. One night while walking with his persocom, Hiroyasu, lost in thought, walked into the middle of the street, unaware of an oncoming car. In one final moment of clarity, his persocom pushed him out of the way, and was herself run over. Her last words to Hiroyasu were, \"Konnichiwa.\"\n\nHiroyasu and Yumi Omura were in love in the past, but broke up when Yumi quit her job at the bakery when she discovered that the persocom he married was named \"Yumi\" and feared she would never live up to the other Yumi. Through the help of Chi and Hideki, he and Yumi resume their relationship.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

It is initially implied that Yumi was interested in a relationship with Hideki, but as the series progresses it is revealed that she initially approached him because he also worked at Club Pleasure, and that she thinks of him as a big brother. Throughout most of the series Yumi has an inferiority complex toward persocoms, and becomes upset at any mention of a human-sized persocom. \n\nThe reason for this is that while Yumi was working at Chiroru she fell in love with the manager, Hiroyasu Ueda. She gathered the courage to tell him, and found out that he reciprocated her feelings. All would have been well, except that Yumi discovered that Ueda had previously been married to a persocom that he had named Yumi, and she thought that he would compare the human Yumi to the persocom Yumi and find the human Yumi inferior.\n\nHowever, Hideki eventually manages to persuade Yumi that Hiroyasu wouldn't have started anything if he didn't love Yumi for who she was, and he and Yumi start going out again."

This marks the beginning of Watanuki's very involved part-time job, a fated meeting with a certain quartet from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, and so many \"chance\" happenings which occur not out of coincidence, but \"hitsuzen\".\n\r\nWatanuki is known for a having both a volatile and caring nature to him. Depending upon the person he talks to, his emotions tend to be overly exaggerated. With Himawari he throws himself into the air accompanied by hearts and a \"Himawari-chaaaaan!!\" squeal. With Domeki, he almost always expresses irritation with various facial expressions, screaming, and arm motions that reminds Himawari of an angry cat. With the exception of these two and Y\u016bko, Watanuki tends to address everyone around him with formality and kindness.\n\r\nOne of Watanuki's greater problems, especially early on in the manga, is his lack of self-worth. He found absolutely no value in himself and would often use himself to aid another, even if his life were at stake. \n\nAn example of this is when he willingly gives up his right eye to the Spider's Grudge to save Domeki's, without considering how much his decision might hurt Domeki. He's forced to face up to this problem when trying to save the Zashiki-Warashi from the Joro-Gumo, when the spider matron harshly chastises him for his lack of consideration for both his own self and those who cared about him. Faced with the facts of how much he's hurt those around him, Watanuki begins to see some value in himself. He will still often use himself to save others, but now he is mindful of just how much his actions hurt other people.\r\nLife for Watanuki changes significantly once he starts working as Yuuko's assistant (rather, her very indignant indentured servant) who not only cooks (wonderfully), cleans (diligently), and complains (constantly), but finds himself performing very odd jobs and learning more about the occult. \n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, xxxHolic Wikia)"

That aside, Y\u016bko has served as a major catalyst for Watanuki's transformation, acting somewhat as his mentor. She loves to drink and eat Watanuki's wonderful cooking and dragging Watanuki on crazy outings at the drop of a hat.\n\r\nDespite this immature and free-spirited attitude, Y\u016bko has been known to be sage-like and serious when the time calls for it. Y\u016bko seems to know the true hitsuzen that Watanuki will follow, and has often offered cryptic messages to warn him of impending danger or a folk tale that he should take a bit more seriously. She also seems to truly care about him, making sure he is safe at night, sending the Kudakitsune (pipe-fox) with him for extra protection, or calling D\u014dmeki when he needs saving.\n\r\nY\u016bko is very powerful when it comes to magic and knowledge and is highly respected within the spirit realm. However, she doesn't often appear to get directly involved in things beyond whatever contract she has with those making wishes. Sometimes, she sends Watanuki to do jobs for her, such as when she granted a wish from Himawari. Y\u016bko seems to take the role of someone playing chess when it comes to the big picture of things that are going on. \n\r\nIn Horitsuba Gakuen, she is a ruthless principal, who always climbs into rooms through the window."

Bizarre ghostly incidents start to happen in Matsumoto affecting his best friend Yuzuru. When he meets a mysterious man called Tachibana Yoshiaki, Takaya finds out that he is the reincarnation of Uesugi Kagetora, the leader of the Uesugi Yashashu. It is his duty to fight malevolent ghostly troopers and the restless spirits of ancient lords and warriors.\n\r\nIt seems that here in the twentieth century, all the fierce major warlords and heroes of the Sengoku Period (the Civil Wars) have been reborn in various parts of the country, and have been given a second chance at plunging Japan into the vicious territorial Civil Wars of their own time. Some lords reawaken their failed ambitions to control the country, some pursue revenge on old enemies and recover lost loves, and some nobles just try to protect their homelands and peoples as guardian gods of the lands. Now, the Yami-Sengoku (Dark Civil Wars) are unfolding.\n\r\nKagetora has been reborn several times during the last 400 years as the powerful Reincarnate (Kanshosha), with psychic abilities and continuous memories, and with a special power to purify and exorcise unredeemed spirits.\n\r\nHowever, his current reincarnation, Takaya, does not have his original memories, and represses his identity as Kagetora, for reasons which are initially unrevealed. Nevertheless, he's thrown into brutal psychic fights with reincarnated fighters and spirits of the land. Initially, he involves himself reluctantly because his beloved friend Yuzuru Narita is targeted. Soon, Takaya assumes the role of commander and fighter with boundless, sometimes destructive powers. Despite his outside aloofness and darkness, he cares for his men, his close friends and his younger sister, trying to carry on the lonely and thankless duty laid on him by Lord Uesugi Kenshin 400 years ago.\n\r\nUesugi Kagetora was a relatively obscure historical figure. He died young in an internal power struggle in the Uesugi family 400 years ago. He was a son adopted by Lord Uesugi Kenshin, initially as a hostage from the neighboring Houjou Clan, but was deeply respected and loved by Lord Kenshin."

He protects Takaya, trying to make him again into a powerful proud leader. However, he seems to have many dark secrets and a lot of guilt from their previous lives together which Takaya does not remember.\n\r\nIn this life, Naoe was born into a Buddhist monk's family, and is now a tall, well-groomed handsome man in his late 20s.\n\r\nOn the surface, Naoe is calm, reserved and competent, albeit too secretive, and a reliable right hand man to Takaya (Kagetora). In a few volumes, however, we discover his true nature, his boundless passion and obsession with Takaya (Kagetora), and his strong attraction to and burning envy of Takaya's superiority. The intense painful love- hate relationship between the two protagonists is a driving force of the whole series.\n\r\nNaoe loves Takaya and devotes himself entirely to him but he resents Takaya's superior strength, power, and independence in the relationship. Naoe cares for Takaya, calms him when needed, and would die for him, but also nurses a devouring desire for and resentment towards him. It is suggested that Naoe did something brutal and unforgivable 30 years ago to Kagetora's then (female) lover Minako, and the tragedy caused Takaya's loss of memory in this lifetime."

When he was young, his pack and family were slaughtered when the forest where he lived was burned to the ground by Jagara's troops. He was then raised by a native who told him that he had a purpose, explaining why the forest spared his life. This native told him that he would have a great journey ahead of him, and that journey was to find paradise. Kiba begins his quest for paradise in the hope that there he will finally find peace. He tends to be distrustful of humans, and in the early episodes is reluctant to take a human form, even when it's more convenient. He also has a \"love\" for Cheza, which may only be due to the fact that she can lead them to paradise. Kiba seems to be an Arctic wolf in the series.\nIt is revealed later in the series that he is, in fact, the chosen one who is destined to find and open paradise.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\r\nKiba's name means \"fang\" in Japanese."

During the fight, Tsume attempted to flee, leaving all of his dead and dying brethren behind. Because of this, the rest of his group disowned him and the leader attacked him, leaving him with a large X-shaped scar across his chest. He was filled with shame, and for many years after didn't associate with any other packs. However, he eventually meets Toboe, who at first seems to annoy him. But, deep down, Tsume feels sympathy and compassion for Toboe, who is the one who eventually convinces him to come with the rest of the \"pack\" to Paradise. He initially doesn't believe the stories of Paradise, and only follows the others out of an instinct to protect them and stay part of a pack. He often fights with Kiba. However, he does eventually become a believer and enjoy the company of his pack mates. After Kiba, he seems to be the best fighter among all the wolves and also seems to be more logical and observant than all the other wolves; thus it can be argued that he is the most intelligent. Tsume seems to be a Grey wolf or tundra wolf in the anime series. \r\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\r\nTsume's name means \"claw\" in Japanese."

There, he lived with an old woman (said to be his grandmother), Momo Hinamori, and possibly other people. Little else is known about his past, but it is known that he became a Shinigami shortly after Hinamori. He is also a friend of Jidanbou, the West Gate Keeper, and was the one who taught him the \"city rules.\"\n\r\nAs a child, Hitsugaya was a bit of a brat who liked to eat watermelons and poke fun at Hinamori. She would call him \"Shiro-chan\" (\u30b7\u30ed\u3061\u3083\u3093, \"Lil' Shiro\" in the English dub) and he would counter by calling her \"Bed-wetter Momo.\" The two were close friends and Hitsugaya, despite being younger and much shorter than his friend, always felt that he needed to protect her. His favorite foods are watermelon and sweet natt\u014d. He also hates hot weather.\n\r\nWith Hitsugaya's natural talent, he quickly entered the Shinigami institute shortly after Hinamori, despite his age. She continued to call him \"Shiro-chan\" out of habit and felt she needed to protect him. Because of a promise she had made, she only began to call him \"Hitsugaya-kun\" after he had achieved his Zanpakut\u014d's initial release and was recognized as a Shinigami. Highly capable and knowledgeable, he quickly became the youngest of the Captains within the Gotei 13 (Thirteen Court Guard Squads).\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia; BleachExile)"

Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he's named just Piccolo).\n\r\nDragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu's victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu & Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins & Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) & consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek).\n\r\nIn Dragon Ball GT, which is not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by Pilaf via the Black-Star Dragon Balls. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. After collecting the spheres, Gokuu does battle with Baby (a Tuffle who wants revenge on all Saiyans for killing his race), Super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy Artificial Human 17) and various Evil Dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the Dragon Balls; they are called Shadow Dragons in FUNimation's dub). The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.\n\r\nIn Dragon Ball Online (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, in which Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike Dragon Ball GT), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.\n\r\nIn Cross Epoch, the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.\n\r\nIn Dragon Ball Minus, it is revealed that Gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (Gine & Bardock) to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Gokuu leaves Planet Vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away.\n\r\nGokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. He will eat anything without much qualms. He has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (Gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). Gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned Krillin's marriage to Android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). Despite his kind-hearted nature, Gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. He has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. Because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. His most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence.\n\r\nHe's so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. Such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by Beerus at Bulma's birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy Gero's lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents' strength even though it might've meant the destruction of mankind. This is also touched upon when he spares Vegeta for a rematch in the Saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. However, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against Cell so that Earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, Goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent).\n\r\nGoku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of Dragon Ball Kai. In Dragon Ball Super Ep. 4, Goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. He has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with Gohan in the Androids arc, Goten & Trunks in the Buu arc, and Uub at the end of the series).\n\r\n(Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Character Guide)"

Such grade-skipping would be unthinkable in Japan, and the series humorously explores its potential consequences. The other characters find Chiyo amazingly cute, but sometimes take advantage of both her youthfulness and her scholastic abilities. Her diminutive stature leads to her having a lack of confidence, particularly in sports where she fears she is a burden to others. Chiyo is frequently viewed with jealousy by fellow students, initially because of her intelligence, but later also because of the discovery that her family is exceedingly wealthy (they own an enormous mansion and a summer house which Chiyo invites her classmates to visit on several occasions). The stylistic rendering of Chiyo's pigtails allow for several visual gags in both the manga and anime: Osaka often imagines them to be flapping wings, or as entities independent of Chiyo herself. At home, she can almost always be found in the company of her enormous dog, Tadakichi-san. Of all of the girls, she is the only one who does not sit through college \"entrance exams\" as she intends to study overseas, possibly in America."

She has always been in love with him (in Japan, such relationships between first cousins are legal and generally accepted) and must learn how to deal with these feelings, especially with the threat that he may fall for one of the other girls. She adores strawberry sundaes, but the mere mention of her mother's \"special\" homemade jam makes her sick.\n\r\nNayuki is a heavy sleeper, which has led her to collect dozens of alarm clocks; they do not work on her, but instead wake Yuichi every morning. Since she has such trouble waking up, she is always running for school and is in fact the school's star runner because of this. Similarly, she became the captain of the school's female track team despite being in her second year. She takes a long time to get up in the morning and will pass out several times during the morning before completely waking up. Despite her attempts to stay conscious, she still tends to fall asleep a lot in class.\n\r\nNayuki has a fondness for animals and never misses an opportunity to try to pet one, even wild animals, such as cats, dogs, or even the occasional fox if she can help it. Unfortunately for her, she is allergic to cats. One of her defining features is that she tends to talk slower than the rest of the characters. She will often state the obvious to Yuichi, such as when lunch break occurs or when school ends.\n\r\nNayuki is second to Ayu as the most used character in the series' marketing. Also, in both anime adaptations, her story runs at the same time as Ayu's."

When Haruhi claimed the empty Literature Club as the SOS Brigade's clubroom, Yuki was found reading there. Haruhi claimed the clubroom and Yuki as part of the Brigade, both of which she didn't mind. She lives alone in the same apartment complex as Ryoko Asakura. She wears glasses and her school uniform at all times, only discarding the former after Kyon babbled that she was cuter without them and that he wasn't a 'glasses man', and the latter when the SOS Brigade went on vacation.\n\nYuki is a \"humanoid interface,\" or artificial human, created by the Integrated Data Entity for the purposes of interacting with and observing events on Earth. Specifically, she is assigned to observe Haruhi, who is the cause of an explosion of data that occurred when she used her godlike powers to recreate the world three years prior.\n\r\nAs an artificial human, she has numerous paranormal abilities. She is capable of manipulating the properties of the environment and any materials within it at any scale to her desire, referred to as \"bogus magic\" by Kyon. For instance, she can create a baseball bat that only hits home runs, nullify data links (removing other artificial interface connections from their bodies), plus she is able to make a cover up story (since Ryoko was gone, she made a cover up story that she moved to Canada), and reconstruct a classroom, down to the last detail, after everything in it was completely destroyed. As a result, she is capable of feats of superhuman strength, agility, and stamina. In one instance, she was unfazed while impaled by multiple metal spikes, and effortlessly reconstructed her body afterwards. Her state also affords her an extreme level of intelligence. She can comprehend the rules and concepts of a game instantaneously, as well as create flawless strategies based on her observations, and was able to learn how to play a guitar mere moments after receiving one.\n\r\nYuki has a very stoic and introverted personality, preferring simple body language rather than speaking. When prompted to speak, she does so in a very concise manner, always speaking in a monotone and displaying a dispassionate complexion. She thinks very rationally, and finds it difficult to communicate with normal humans due to her intelligence and lack of empathy. She enjoys reading, and is seen reading a book in the majority of her appearances. As the series continues, she develops a sense of humor, although her unchanging facial expressions make it near-impossible to discern whether she is joking or not. Despite her reserved manner, she is reliable and trustworthy, resulting in Kyon trusting her more than other members of the SOS Brigade.\n\r\nYuki is described by Haruhi as the SOS Brigade's \"indispensable silent character.\" She was neither recruited by nor did she join the Brigade but was actually included along with the room when Haruhi arrived and declared it as her own. Whenever she is in the club room, she is usually reading. Similar to Itsuki Koizumi, Yuki is obedient when orders are given; however, her loyalties lie more with Kyon rather than Haruhi. The other members often rely on Yuki and her abilities whenever needed most, notably when the SOS Brigade was losing in the baseball tournament, the contest against the Computer Society, and in the case of the Cave Cricket. Aside from this role, she is also responsible for Kyon's safety, as evident when she saved him from an attack by Ry\u014dko, since Kyon's presence stabilizes Haruhi's emotions.\n\r\nIn the SOS Brigade's amateur movie production The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina, Yuki was cast as the leading antagonist. She was portrayed as an alien, who could also use magic.\n\r\nKyon also realized after the \"cave cricket\" incident that Yuki plays a \"behind the scenes\" role, making her one of the puppeteers whose goals are to ensure Haruhi is fully satisfied and that order and balance are maintained. Her intentions of being in the Brigade are to monitor Haruhi and prevent her from feeling bored or greatly disappointed because it is generally believed by the Integrated Data Entity that a drastic event that could end the universe would occur. It is also believed that Haruhi is also the key to evolution and thus it is important for Yuki and other humanoid interfaces to continue their observations. She also has the ability to detect any spatial changes in the environment caused by Haruhi and will act to prevent them from persisting. An example of this is during the unscripted attack in the first fight scene of the Brigade movie, when she tackled Mikuru in order to remove her contact lens which had temporarily caused the fictional \"Mikuru Beam\" to become real."

In the series, she is introduced declaring her interests in aliens, espers and time travelers and does not care for \"ordinary\" human beings. The last thing on her mind is a normal high school life. With a burning desire to find such phenomena in the world, she is generally unapproachable and finds ordinary people boring and uninteresting. As a result of this, many of her classmates choose to avoid and confront her. She deals with her emotions by creating a parallel universe, where she inadvertently releases transparent creatures who tear up and destroy everything that comes into contact with them. Espers are the ones who can stop these creatures by cutting and destroying them, because if these creatures are left alone destroying everything as well as the outer barrier it could affect the outside world. She also likes to dress up Mikuru in random outfits.\n\r\nKyon is the first character to engage with her in a serious conversation. From this encounter, she gradually begins to soften up to others and starts to open up with her classmates. Later on, Haruhi took Kyon against his will and forced him to help her start the SOS Brigade, thus she has taken an unknown interests to Kyon later in the series. It is hinted that one of the reasons as to why Haruhi opened up to Kyon was that he resembled John Smith; John Smith and Kyon are the same person.\n\r\nShe is noted as smart, athletic, and naturally talented in any extra-curricular activities. She once joined every activity club in her school and quit because she found them boring, despite pleas by the club members for her membership. Her musical talent was highlighted when she stood in as the emergency lead singer and guitarist, along with Yuki, for the band ENOZ during the school festival.\n\nHer childhood is cited as an originator for her interests in strange phenomena. While attending a baseball game with her family, she was shocked to see the vast number of people who had come to see the game. Before then, she had often thought of herself and her life as being special and interesting, yet then came to realize that they were just ordinary normal occurrences and habits and that she is just one of many living human in all of Japan in which Japan is just part of Earth. Consequently, she believed then that there must be at least one person in the world who is living an interesting and truly unique life and sought out to effectively be that person thus motivating her to seek out the extraordinary.\n\r\nAfter this realization she became notorious in middle school for doing odd things which included painting strange hieroglyphs all over the school grounds using a field marker and placing all the school desks in the halls. Additionally, she accepted and rejected every guy who had ever asked her out, the longest lasting a week and the shortest being five minutes. She only seeks relationships with aliens, espers, and time travelers. This shows the depth of her interest in finding non-humans and strange phenomena.\nIn actuality, Haruhi is believed to be either a crack in the space-time continuum, the first technological singularity to be spontaneously born in the universe, or some sort of deity, depending on point of view. This belief stems from a massive spontaneous universal event that occurred three years prior to Haruhi meeting Kyon, of which Haruhi is said to be the cause. The event attracted the attention of three prominent groups: the Extraterrestrial Integrated Data Entity, time travelers from a distant future, and a group of espers known as the \"Agency.\"\n\r\nHer powers which are capable of altering, creating, or destroying reality are triggered by her emotions and inner desires. It's been theorized by the espers that the current universe may be just one in a string that Haruhi had subconsciously created. In order to relieve stress whenever she becomes too emotionally unstable, patches of alternate dimension referred to as \"closed space\" are created and within resides gigantic blue entities that destroy the surrounding area. Despite having these powers Haruhi is completely oblivious to them or the existence of aliens, time travelers, and espers.\r\nPersonality\r\nAt first, Haruhi seems very indifferent and cold but underneath that front she is very spontaneous, upbeat, and hyperactive. Her determination, persistence, and resourcefulness drive her endeavors of finding strange phenomenon and promoting the SOS Brigade. Because of her dedication, she becomes hot-headed when things don't go her way. Hand-in-hand with her cleverness and creativity, and a certain ruthlessness, even seeming amorality, she can often get what she wants, an example of such is when she blackmailed the Computer Society President into giving her a brand new computer for the SOS Brigade. Haruhi tends to pursue her goals regardless of who gets in the way, or is hurt, such as Mikuru in the aforementioned blackmail. She also has a tendency to be jealous and angry when Kyon gets too friendly with any girl. Evidently, the universe was almost destroyed and recreated when Haruhi's jealousy was pushed too far.\n\r\nHaruhi also has a very competitive personality and accepts without hesitation any challenge that crosses her, regardless of difficulty or time constraint. Her constant optimism and over-confidence make her seem arrogant. She has very high standards and won't accept anything less than perfection from herself and her Brigade. She places a lot of trust in her Brigade members, especially Kyon, to get the task done whatever it may be. This can sometimes make her seem selfish and unkind.\n\r\nShe is not shy and often attracts a lot of attention to the point of not minding changing clothes in front of various people, more so when her SOS Brigade is in mind. When it comes to Mikuru she is very physically playful. She often comments on Mikuru's attractiveness and seems to find a kind of enjoyment in exploiting it to her own ends, often through forcing Mikuru into and out of various costumes such as a bunny girl costume as if she were a human dress-up doll.\n\nHaruhi also seems to hate showing signs of vulnerability to others. Following her concert performance at the school's culture festival when she and Yuki filled in for two members of the band ENOZ, Haruhi showed awkwardness toward the band members when they thanked her the following day. As Kyon pointed out, Haruhi was not used to receiving praise from others because of how mischievous she regularly acts toward others because of her abnormal interests.\n\r\nThough many of Haruhi's efforts are devoted to finding supernatural beings, she does not actually believe in them. This is suggested by Itsuki during the first light novel, that Haruhi does not force himself, Yuki, or Mikuru to reveal themselves because her commonsense will not let her believe that they exist. In fact, between the first and second light novels, when Kyon tries to convince Haruhi that the other SOS Brigade members are more than they appear, she does not believe him. Later, she bases The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina on Kyon's story.\n\r\nSOS Brigade role\r\nHaruhi is the founder and \"Brigade Chief\" of the SOS Brigade, or Saving The World by Overloading it with Fun Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade. She was unable to find any existing club suitable to her preferences. She made the group in order to find and have fun with aliens, espers, and time travelers. Upon creation, she names herself as its leader. Her method of finding and recruiting members is to \"voluntarily arrest\" them then force them to join.\n\r\nThe SOS Brigade is very precious to her and has stated to Kyon that she has no intention of yielding her position as Chief to anyone else. She will go to any lengths, even by exploiting the members, to bring attention and support for her Brigade such as procuring room and materials, maintaining their website, participating in sports tournaments, organizing activities such as city-wide searches for strange phenomenon among other things. She wrote, produced, and directed the Brigade's amateur-movie The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina for the school festival.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to her is the true purpose of the SOS Brigade: to prevent Haruhi from becoming bored, as her boredom would bring about the end of the world as the SOS Brigade's members know it. Kyon also happens to be a very important person in her life. For whatever reason, Haruhi \"chose\" Kyon. This is first said by Yuki, then restated by Mikuru, and Itsuki as well. She often relies on and trusts Kyon with anything. Kyon is the only person whom she has been open with, and when she briefly created a \"new world,\" he was the only person she had brought over from the \"old world.\" These are all made evident in the fourth novel The Vanishment of Haruhi Suzumiya, where she remained at Kyon's side for the three days he was in a coma due to a small accident; however, he is apparently worth far more to her than even she realizes. Unknown to her, the person she knew as John Smith, who \"helped\" her draw weird symbols at the schoolyard of East Junior High (her old school) at night on Tanabata three years prior, is in fact, Kyon from the present time, sent back in time. Furthermore, his time there unintentionally created an alternate timeline where no SOS Brigade existed, Yuki, Mikuru, Ryoko, Itsuki, and Haruhi were normal humans and the latter two never transferred to North High, thus no SOS Brigade. Only by going back to that night again was Kyon able to set things right. Finally, should Kyon reveal to Haruhi that he is John Smith, it would radically change everything, as he stated to the Integrated Data Entity through Yuki."

She is defined by Kyon to be extremely cute, and is often sexually harassed by Haruhi Suzumiya.\n\nShe is in fact a time traveller from the future with the purpose of observing Haruhi during the course of the story line.\r\nConsidered one of the most beautiful girls in high school Mikuru is as kind, caring and thoughtful as she is beautiful. She easily gets scared or flustered, and is apparently prone to daydreaming as she can also be rather clumsy at times. Nevertheless, she can be surprisingly resilient and is capable of recovering from even the most discomforting of situations. However, because of her gentle nature she seems rather helpless most of the time. Kyon sees it as his duty to always watch over and protect her, although, when it comes to Haruhi there is no rescue.\n\r\nMikuru is the designated \"mascot\" of the SOS Brigade, serving as a way to attract interest and members by using her attractive physical qualities\u2014her cute face, trim figure, and noticeably sizable bust. She was \"voluntarily arrested\" by Haruhi, who deemed it necessary to have an alluring lolita type in the club. Her sex appeal and innocence is often exploited by Haruhi to procure resources. Mikuru is on a regular occasion forced to wear any outfits that Haruhi buys for her. Haruhi also sees it fit that Mikuru is unable to dress and undress by herself most times and often does it for her, much to Mikuru's considerable\u2014and vocal\u2014distress. So far, Mikuru has worn the following outfits: maid, waitress, nurse, frog costume, cheerleader, miko, and the infamous bunny-girl.\n\r\nThe name \"Mikuru (\u307f\u304f\u308b)\" is derived from \"Miku\" which when written in Kanji is \"Mirai (\u672a\u6765)\" (\"future\" in Japanese)."

Although he is an esper, which is exactly one of the sorts of people Haruhi desires to meet, Itsuki never reveals himself as such, at least, not to her.\r\nItsuki is constantly smiling and always speaks in a formal and polite manner. He is also prone to giving long and detailed explanations, usually illustrated by exaggerated hand gestures. Itsuki has confirmed to Kyon once that his outer personality is merely an artificial image he fakes in accordance to Haruhi's impression of him, and hints that his true character is something quite different, being \"less pleasing\" in the eyes of others. Maintaining his casual, constantly smiling self, however, is vital for keeping Haruhi's mentality balanced.\n\r\nOut of the three Brigade members, Kyon is the least fond of Itsuki. He often finds himself annoyed with Itsuki's plastic smile, his willingness to acquiesce to Haruhi's outrageous schemes, playful teasing and his various forays into his psychological and philosophical theories (e.g., omphalos hypothesis, Anthropic principle, etc.). He is also distrustful of Itsuki's intentions, comparing him to Yuki Nagato when it comes to deciphering his expressions. Itsuki's fondness for speculation often causes him to produce explanations for situations involving the SOS Brigade, its members and related events. Ironically, Itsuki can only share his theories with Kyon and also enthusiastically plays different kinds of board games with him to pass the time, despite losing all the time, although Kyon suspects that he may be doing so on purpose.\n\nDespite the theory he advances in which Haruhi is the equivalent of God, Itsuki says that there are many differing lines of speculation about Haruhi within \"The Agency.\" Itsuki himself does not believe in a singular God, nor does he regard Haruhi as such, although he reveals that he has colleagues that do. Apparently, most of the questions that he raises about Haruhi's true nature are philosophical in nature and do not necessarily represent his personal beliefs. Itsuki also reveals that the majority of \"The Agency\" advocates observing Haruhi instead of doing anything that might provoke her.\nIn the Disappearance arc, the altered Koizumi reveals that he has a crush on Haruhi. This does not necessarily mean that the real Koizumi harbors such feelings, but it is possible that he would have feelings for her if Kyon would not be Haruhi's love interest.\nIn the Astonishment arc, Koizumi is revealed to be the leader and founder of the Agency. Furthermore, he reveals part of his true personality when he blows up at the aliens and time travelers for meddling. More or less, he threatens war against both factions should they continuing tampering with Haruhi. Koizumi also says that he is a part of Haruhi's subconscious made physical, although he never explains what he means more fully. He seems especially suspicious of the time travelers, particularly Asahina (Adult)."

            "description": "At first, Ryouko appears to be a compassionate and hard-working high school girl. One of Kyon's friends, Taniguchi, places her in the top three first-year girls in the school with a grade of AA+: indicative of her pleasant personality, beauty, and athleticism. Her enormous popularity made her the unanimous choice for class president of Kyon's homeroom class. She also showed particular concern about how Haruhi had distanced herself from the rest of the class.\n\nHowever, it turns out that she is Yuki's backup, and as such, is also another \"humanoid interface.\" Much like Yuki, she finds it difficult to empathize with humans, but unlike Yuki, possesses exceptional social skills. Initially she cheerfully supports Kyon's reaching out to Haruhi, often encouraging him to \"open her up to the class,\" making Haruhi easier to observe. However, she later decides to try and kill Kyon with a combat knife in the hopes of catalyzing an observable reaction from Haruhi. Her efforts are stopped, after Yuki defeated and removed her from the physical world. It's interesting to note that her cheerful personality doesn't falter, even at the moment of her own demise. Afterwards, Yuki fabricated a cover story that she moved to Canada.\n\r\nRyouko makes a reappearance in the Disappearance arc, on an alternate timeline in which Haruhi never attends North High or forms an SOS Brigade. In this timeline she is just a normal human and is very kind to the shy Nagato; however, this Ryoko's timeline is obssesed with her; when she seemingly sees Kyon trying to shoot Nagato with a gun, she stabs him with a knife, believing that this is what Yuki wanted, it was briefly shown that Ryoko may show feelings for Nagato and would do anything to protect her.\r\nIn the Astonishment arc, Ryouko takes her rightful place as Nagato's backup since Nagato became ill. While she still wishes to kill Kyon (and even goes to far as to tell him this with a smile on her face), she ironically saves him twice from Kuyou. Kyon made the decision that she should not enroll at North High again (as he doesn't want to provoke Haruhi) which she agrees to. Ryouko is currently unable to attack Kyon because Emiri was given special counter-measures against Ryouko's attacks. Because of this, Ryouko is actually a bit of an ally to Kyon at this point."

            "description": "Tsuruya is the hyperactive friend of Mikuru (from the current time plane) notable for her loud voice, ankle-length hair, and prominent tooth. She possesses a cheerful and friendly disposition. She is also prone to long fits of unrestrained and intense laughter at things she considers even the slightest bit humorous.\n\r\nHer fang-like tooth gives her an idiosyncratic speech pattern, causing her to misspeak words by leaving out syllables, as seen in episode 9. Her speech pattern is often accompanied with a lisp and her catch phrases \"megas\" and \"nyoro.\" Her knowledge of the SOS Brigade comes almost exclusively from Mikuru. She is also the heir of the Tsuruya family, which purportedly collaborates with Itsuki's Agency. It is also unknown if Tsuruya has a secret identity or agenda.\n\r\nThough not an actual member of the SOS Brigade, she does play a minor role in Mikuru Asahina's Adventure - Episode 00 and serves on their baseball team in episode four. She also has a small appearance in the ninth and twelfth episodes of the anime, but otherwise appears relatively sparingly throughout the anime. She appears a few more times during the novels, appearing more prominently than in the anime's rendition of the same stories, and even getting along very well with Haruhi. Kyon believes this is because both Haruhi and Tsuruya are nearly insane. Though she is not a brigade member, Tsuruya is still used as an extra body for some of the Brigade's activities.\n\nIn the light novels, it is strongly implied that Tsuruya's wealthy and venerable family is a covert supporter of \"the Agency\" to which Itsuki Koizumi belongs. Tsuruya herself seems to possess some knowledge of the secrets of the SOS Brigade and other matters, although she never explicitly says so. Tsuruya temporarily takes care of Mikuru Asahina during an event when the latter has a double presence in the \"present\" of the SOS Brigade and is also the caretaker of a mysterious artifact discovered on her family's grounds, both at Kyon's request.\nIn the original light novel The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, Tsuruya's role in the altered reality is that of Mikuru Asahina's best friend. She is shown to be extremely protective of her, even resorting to violence to keep her safe, but still maintains her cheerful disposition."
