- Transfer database to drive on host pc in batches, probabaly 1000 at a time
    - log the waifus with no descriptions or images to be looked at in the future

- waifu statistics system
 - ask James?

- create a system that allows you to claim waifus
    - .list
    - use the unique discord id of the user to add that unique version of their waifu to the list
    - create the option to let the waifu go
    - each unique version of a waifu will have it's own UUID
    - in order for this to work, a waifu statistic system must be implemented first
